Next, let $g(x)=\\frac{h(x)}{x}$, which is defined on $(0,1)$, and note that\n$$\nf(x,y) = \\frac{g(xy)}{g(x)+g(y)}.\n$$\n\nWe first show that $f$ is minimized on the diagonal, namely at some point $(x,x)$. Assume that $f$ is minimized at some point $(x^*,y^*)$, and let $\\alpha = f(x^*,y^*)$. Define \n$$\nF(x,y) = g(xy) - \\alpha (g(x)+g(y)).\n$$\nThen $F(x,y) \\ge 0$ for all $x,y \\in (0,1)^2$ and $F(x^*, y^*)=0$. \nThus the partial derivatives of $F$ must be zero at the minimum point:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x^*,y^*)=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x^*,y^*)=0.\n$$\nEvaluating the derivatives gives\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x,y) = g'(xy) \\cdot y - \\alpha g'(x), \\qquad\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x,y) = g'(xy) \\cdot x - \\alpha g'(y).\n$$\nDefine $G(x)=x g'(x)$ and note that we obtained that $G(x^*)=G(y^*)$.
