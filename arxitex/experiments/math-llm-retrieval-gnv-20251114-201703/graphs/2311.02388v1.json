Notice that \n$$\\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-1, 1, 0, 1)] = 0$$ \naccording to equation~(\\ref{eq nim 01q1}) and \n$$\\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p', 1, q-1, 1)] = 2p'.$$\nObserve that, this will cover all the even numbers up to \n$2(p-3)$, and up to $2(p-2)$ if $p$ is even. \n\nTherefore, we only need to think about the case when $p$ is odd and $n_1 = 2(p-1)$. In this case, $n_1$ is divisible by $4$. \nConsider the child obtained by connecting $x_{p-1}$ with $y_{q-2}$. \nThis will imply that $CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p, 1, q, 1)$ has a child having nimber \n$$\\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-2, 1, q-3, 1)] \\oplus \\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:1, 1, 2, 1)] = (n_1-4) \\oplus 2 = n_1  - 2.$$ \nThus we are done when \n$(q+1) \\geq 2(p-1) - \\lfloor \\frac{|(p-1)-2|}{2} \\rfloor$. \n\n\\medskip\n\nOn the other hand, if $(q+1) < 2(p-1) - \\lfloor \\frac{|(p-1)-2|}{2} \\rfloor$, then $p < q$ implies $p-1 < q+1$, \nby induction hypothesis we have \n$\\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-1, 1, q+1, 1)] = n_1$. \n\nThus, in particular, for each $l \\in \\{2, 4, \\cdots, n_1-2\\}$, there exists \na child of $CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-1, 1, q+1, 1)$ having nimber equal to \n$l$. \nObserve that, this child must be a sum of two games of the form \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p', 1, q', 1)$ and \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-2, 1, q-q', 1)$. \nDue to equation~(\\ref{eq balanced unbalanced}), we know that one of these children will satisfy the conditions of the\nsecond line of the formula given in Theorem~\\ref{th nimber}. \n\nNext consider the child of $CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p, 1, q, 1)$ obtained by connecting $x_{p'+1}$ and $y_{q'+1}$ \ncan be expressed as a sum of \nthe games \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p', 1, q', 1)$ and \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-1, 1, q-q'-1, 1)$. \nDue to equation~(\\ref{eq balanced unbalanced}), we know that one of these children will satisfy the conditions of the second line of \nthe formula given in Theorem~\\ref{th nimber}. \n\nIn fact as $p \\neq q$, it is possible to assume \nwithout loss of generality that both \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-2, 1, q-q', 1)$ and \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-1, 1, q-q'-1, 1)$ \nsatisfy the conditions of the\nsecond line of the formula given in Theorem~\\ref{th nimber}. \n\n\nThis implies \n\\begin{align*}\n    \\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-2, 1, q-q', 1)] &= \\frac{4}{5}(p+q-p'-q'-2 - i_1) + 2 \\lfloor \\frac{i_1}{2} \\rfloor\\\\ \n    &= \\eta[CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-1, 1, q-q'-1, 1)].\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, we can conclude that this game, expressed as a sum of $CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p', 1, q', 1)$ and \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p-p'-1, 1, q-q'-1, 1)$, \nwhich is a child of \n$CS_4(\\mathcal{P}_4:p, 1, q, 1)$, has nimber equal to $l$."}, {"id": "theorem-22-c2cab3", "type": "theorem", "content": "\\label{cor nimber of bs}\nThe nimber of the game $BS_2(\\mathcal{P}_4:p,q)$ is $0$ for all $p,q \\geq 3$.", "content_preview": "\\\\label{cor nimber of bs}<br>The nimber of the game $BS_2(\\\\mathcal{P}_4:p,q)$ is $0$ for all $p,q \\\\geq 3$.", "prerequisites_preview": "", "display_name": "Theorem", "label": "cor nimber of bs", "position": {"line_start": 1748, "line_end": 1750, "col_start": 1, "col_end": 14}, "references": [{"target_id": "th nimber", "reference_type": "internal", "context": "\\oplus \\eta[CS_4(1,1,t_3,1)] = 0$ due to  Theorem~\\ref{th nimber}, the child of the root must have a non-zero nimbe", "full_reference": null, "arxiv_id": null, "note": null}], "proof": "Observe that in the game tree of \n$BS_2(\\mathcal{P}_4:p,q)$, the root has exactly one child as the very first move is unique up to renaming of open tips. \nMoreover, that child will have a child \nwhich can be expressed as a sum of $CS_4(p,1,1,1)$ and $CS_4(1,1,q,1)$.
