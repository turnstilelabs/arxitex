We study the interplay of these conditions with the partial groups of Chermak, a class of symmetric simplicial sets. The $d$-Segal conditions simplify for symmetric simplicial objects, and take a particularly explicit form for partial groups. We show partial groups provide a rich class of $d$-Segal sets for $d > 2$, by undertaking a systematic study of the \"degree\" of a partial group $X$, namely the smallest $k\\geq 1$ such that $X$ is $2k$-Segal. We develop effective tools to explicitly compute the degree based on the discrete geometry of actions of partial groups, which we define and study. Applying these tools involves solving Helly-type problems for abstract closure spaces. We carry out degree computations in concrete settings, including for the punctured Weyl groups introduced here, where we find that the degree is closely related to the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra of the associated semisimple Lie algebra.",

Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.",

    "abstract": "We investigate structural and rigidity properties of \\emph{Lie skew braces} (LSBs), objects essentially known in the literature as \\emph{post--Lie groups}, obtained by endowing a manifold with two compatible group laws that share the same identity element. LSBs extend skew left braces, which are central to the study of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, to the smooth category. Our first main result shows that, for every connected LSB $(G,\\cdot,\\circ)$, linearity (in the simply-connected case) and solvability carry over from $(G,\\cdot)$ to $(G,\\circ)$, whereas the converse direction is rigid: if $(G,\\circ)$ is nilpotent (respectively, semisimple) then $(G,\\cdot)$ is forced to be solvable (respectively, isomorphic to $(G,\\circ)$). Our second results provides two ``flexibility'' statements: every non-linear simply connected Lie group \\((G, \\cdot )\\) admits an LSB \\((G,\\cdot,\\circ)\\) such that \\((G,\\circ)\\) is linear, and every simply connected solvable Lie group \\((G, \\circ )\\) supports a LSB \\((G,\\cdot,\\circ)\\) such that \\((G,\\cdot)\\) is nilpotent. A third result provides a complete existence table for non-trivial LSBs across the six standard Lie-group classes, abelian, nilpotent (non-abelian), solvable (non-nilpotent), simple, semisimple (non-simple) and mixed type, identifying precisely when a LSB can be built and when only the trivial or no structure occurs. Both the explicit constructions and the properties established in our theorems rely on a factorisation technique for Lie groups, on the correspondence between LSBs and regular subgroups of the affine group $\\operatorname{Aff}(G,\\cdot)$, which renders LSB theory equivalent to simply transitive affine actions, and on the theory of post-Lie algebras together with their integrability properties.",

In $IG(E(P_n))$, the corresponding subgroup is the direct product $Z \\times S_r$.

An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld. Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers.   Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21. We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.",

This paper systematically investigates the variety generated by all ten two-element semirings. We prove that this variety contains exactly 480 subvarieties, each of which is finitely based.",

This structure appears naturally when investigating hyperk\\\"ahler manifolds and the symplectic automorphisms acting on them.

A loop analogue of an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H. Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the center of the loop group.

    "abstract": "These notes expand upon our lectures on {\\em profinite rigidity} at the international colloquium on randomness, geometry and dynamics, organised by TIFR Mumbai at IISER Pune in January 2024. We are interested in the extent to which groups that arise in hyperbolic geometry and 3-manifold topology are determined by their finite quotients. The main theme of these notes is the radical extent to which rigidity is lost when one passes from consideration of groups with hyperbolic features to consideration of their direct products. We describe a general method for producing infinite sequences of {\\em{Grothendieck pairs,}} i.e.~embeddings $P_i\\hookrightarrow G\\times G$ inducing isomorphisms of profinite completions, with $G$ fixed and $P_i$ finitely generated. In order to apply this method, one needs $G$ to map onto a subgroup of finite index in the commutator subgroup of a group $\\Gamma$ with $H_2(\\Gamma,\\mathbb{Z})=0$, and $\\Gamma$ should be relatively hyperbolic. By exploiting the flexibility of the construction, we explain how, under the same hypotheses on $G$, one can construct {\\em uncountable families} of pairwise non-isomorphic subgroups $P_\\lambda$ such that $P_\\lambda\\hookrightarrow G\\times G$ induces an isomorphism of profinite completions. Examples of groups $G$ satisfying these conditions include the fundamental group of the Weeks manifold and the fundamental group of the 4-fold branch cover of the figure-8 knot complement. Both of these examples are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense and in each case Grothendieck pairs account entirely for the loss of profinite rigidity for $G\\times G$: if $H$ is a finitely generated group whose profinite completion is isomorphic to that of $G\\times G$, then there is an embedding $H\\hookrightarrow G\\times G$ that is a Grothendieck pair.",

    "abstract": "Let $\\rho: \\Gamma \\to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\\Omega_\\rho \\subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\\Gamma$-action (via $\\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\\Omega_\\rho$.   When $\\Omega_\\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\\rho(\\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \\setminus \\{\\mathrm{id}\\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.",

On the algorithm side, we generalize the Shor-Kitaev algorithm for HSP in $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ (with standard polynomial query cost) to the case where the hidden subgroup has deficient rank or equivalently infinite index.
