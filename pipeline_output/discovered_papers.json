    "abstract": "Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\\\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\\\"ofer).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct a partial group \\(\\mathcal{P}(F)\\) that represents the \"partial symmetry\" inherent in a subset \\(F\\) of \\(d\\)-dimensional Euclidean space. In cases where \\(F\\) is not connected, \\(\\mathcal{P}(F)\\) captures more detailed information than the conventional symmetry group \\(G(F)\\). To establish a stronger connection between \\(\\mathcal{P}(F)\\) and \\(F\\), we introduce a novel definition of partial group action. Furthermore, to characterize \\(\\mathcal{P}(F)\\) in specific cases, we define partial group actions on other partial groups and present a construction of the corresponding semidirect product.",

    "abstract": "A Rota-Baxter operator on a Lie group $ G $ is a smooth map $ B : G \\to G $ such that $ B(g)B(h) = B(gB(g)hB(g)^{-1}) $ for all $ g, h \\in G $. This concept was introduced in 2021 by Guo, Lang and Sheng as a Lie group analogue of Rota-Baxter operators of weight 1 on Lie algebras. We show that the only Rota-Baxter operators on compact simple Lie groups are the trivial map and the inverse map. A similar description for Rota-Baxter operators of weight 1 on compact simple Lie algebras is provided.",

    "abstract": "Hermitian cubic norm structures were recently introduced in order to study the class of skew-dimension one structurable algebras (which are typically only defined over fields of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$) over arbitrary rings and fields. Here, we generalize the quartic norm for these algebras and show that elements for which the quartic norm is invertible are conjugate invertible. This leads to the notion of a division hermitian cubic norm structure, defined as one in which the quartic norm is anisotropic. We classify such structures in terms of the Tits index of an associated (rank one) adjoint simple linear algebraic group and show that any adjoint linear algebraic group with such a Tits index defines a corresponding hermitian cubic norm structure.",
