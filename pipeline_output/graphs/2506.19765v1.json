In $S$ one can twist the addition \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:twist}\nx\\oplus y=x-1+y\n\\end{equation}\nso that the original multiplication of the ring verifies the brace distributivities. In fact, there is an isomorphism of skew braces $(R,+,\\circ) \\cong (R+1,\\oplus,\\cdot)$ where $R+1=\\{r+1: r\\in R\\}$ (Proposition 2.9 of~\\cite{kepka2007commutative}). Through this isomorphism, the operation $\\circ$ corresponds to the product $\\cdot$ of the ring which is easier to understand.\n    For example, there is an isomorphism of skew braces \n    \\[(F_R(X),+,\\circ)\\cong \\left(\\left\\{\\frac{f}{g}: f,g\\in I(X)+1\\right\\},\\oplus, \\cdot\\right).\\]\nAnother useful perspective is to consider the subset \\( R(X) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}[X]\\), consisting of polynomials whose coefficients sum to one. Via the evaluation map $x\\mapsto x+1$ for all $x\\in X$, one obtains an isomorphism\n\\[(F_R(X),+,\\circ)\\cong \\left(\\left\\{\\frac{f}{g}: f,g\\in R(X)\\right\\},\\oplus, \\cdot\\right).\\]\n $R(X)$ is exactly the set of polynomials which can be written as words in the monomials of $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$. In other words, $f\\in R(X)$ if and only if it can be written as $m_1^{\\oplus\\epsilon_1}\\oplus \\dots \\oplus m_n^{\\oplus\\epsilon_n}$, for some $\\epsilon_i\\in \\{1,-1\\}$ and $m_i$ monomials in $X$, where $m^{\\oplus -1}$ denotes the inverse of $m$ with respect to $\\oplus$. This viewpoint is particularly natural when working with free objects, and it forms the basis for our generalization to construct the free commutative skew brace on $X$.",
