Then, we can either write the attaching path of $\\Tilde{R}$ as $P_1\\Tilde{e}P_2\\Tilde{e}^{-1}$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are closed paths in $\\Tilde{R}$, or we can write it as $P_1P_2$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are closed paths in $\\Tilde{R}$ that traverse $\\Tilde{e}$. In both cases we will use the fact that, since $\\Tilde{X}$ is simply connected, $\\rho_{*}([P_1])=\\rho_{*}([P_2])=1_{\\pi_1X}$. Now, for the latter case, note that $\\partial_pR = \\rho(P_1P_2) = \\rho(P_1)\\rho(P_2)$. This cannot occur since, by Lemma \\ref{essential}, each $\\rho(P_i)$ should be essential in $X$. In the first case, we have two possible situations. If neither $P_1$ nor $P_2$ traverses an edge in $\\rho^{-1}(e)$, then $\\partial_pR = \\rho(P_1P_2) = \\rho(P_1)e\\rho(P_2)e^{-1}$. Since $\\rho(P_1)$ is a closed path on $Y$ and $\\rho_{*}([P_1]) = 1_{\\pi_1X}$, by  Lemma \\ref{injective} $\\partial_pR$ is homotopic in $Y \\cup \\{e\\}$ to $\\rho(P_2)$, a path that does not traverse $e$. This contradicts the definition of elementary reduction. On the other hand, if $P_2$ traverse an edge $\\Tilde{e}_2 \\in \\rho^{-1}(e)$, we can write $\\partial_p\\Tilde{R} = P_1\\Tilde{e}P_2^{1}\\Tilde{e}_2P_2^{2}\\Tilde{e}^{-1}$ with $P_2^{1},P_2^{2}$ subpaths of $P_2$. Up to cyclic conjugation, we get that $\\partial_pR = \\rho(\\Tilde{e}^{-1}P_1\\Tilde{e})\\rho(P_2^{1}\\Tilde{e}_2P_2^{2})$. This is also a contradiction since, by Lemma \\ref{essential}, the closed paths $\\rho(\\Tilde{e}^{-1}P_1\\Tilde{e})$ and $\\rho(P_2^{1}\\Tilde{e}_2P_2^{2})$ should be essential in $X$, but $[\\rho(\\Tilde{e}^{-1}P_1\\Tilde{e})]=\\rho_{*}([\\Tilde{e}^{-1}P_1\\Tilde{e}])=1_{\\pi_1X}$."

      "proof": "Let $X = \\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{P}}$ and let $\\hat X\\to X$ be the cyclic covering of $X$ determined by $\\varphi$. We denote  by $a_{j,i}$ the lift of the edge $a_i$ beginning at the vertex $j$. Let $R_i$ be the $2$-cell of $X$ corresponding to the relator $r_i$ and denote by $R_{j,i}$ the $2$-cell of $\\hat{X}$ that covers $R_i$ for which the minimum $0$-cell is $j$.\n\n\nWe define a total ordering on the edges  $a_{j,i}$ of $\\hat{X}$ as follows. First, for simplicity, we reindex the $k$  relators of $\\pe$ (and the $2$-cells of $ \\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{P}}$) as $ r_{n-k+1}, \\ldots, r_n$ (and $R_{n-k+1}, \\ldots, R_n$). By reordering the relators of $\\pe$ if necessary, we can assume that the weak concatenability occurs in such a way that $\\min(R_{j,i})=a_{j,i}$. The ordering on the edges  $a_{j,i}$ is the lexicographic order on the pairs $(j,i)$. The first coordinate with the usual order of $\\Z$, and the second one with the inverse of the usual order on $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$. It is immediate to check that it is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-invariant ordering.  Given $(j,i)$,  we consider the full subcomplex of $\\hat X$ containing all the $0$-cells $t \\geq j$, and remove from it the $2$-cells $R_{j,s}$ for $s\\geq i+1$ and the $1$-cells $a_{j,s}$ for $s\\geq i+1$. Note that we obtain a well defined subcomplex, which we denote by $\\hat{X}_{j,i}$, since the  $1$-cells $a_{j,s}$ removed do not lie in the boundaries of the remaining $2$-cells $R_{j,l}$. Note also that  $(\\hat{X}_{j,i},\\hat{X}_{j,i-1})$  is an $(R_{j,i},a_{j,i})$-elementary reduction if $i\\geq n-k+1$, since $\\hat{X}_{j,i}$ is obtained from $\\hat{X}_{j,i-1}$ by attaching the $2$-cell $R_{j,i}$ and the $1$-cell $a_{i}$, which is properly involved by definition of weak concatenability. For $1\\leq i\\leq n-k$, $(\\hat{X}_{j,i},\\hat{X}_{j,i-1})$ is just an $(a_{j,i})$-elementary reduction. All the reductions involved are without proper powers since the presentation complex has the homology of a wedge of circles and $\\Z$ is conservative \\cite [Section 5]{h2} (see also \\cite [Theorem 2.5]{bam1}). If $R_1 \\neq R_2$ are $2$-cells of $\\hat{X}$, then $R_1 = R_{j_1,i_1}$ and $R_2 = R_{j_2,i_2}$ for some pairs of integers $(j_1,i_1) \\neq (j_2,i_2)$. Clearly $\\min(R_1)=a_{j_1,i_1} \\neq a_{j_2,i_2} = \\min(R_2)$."
