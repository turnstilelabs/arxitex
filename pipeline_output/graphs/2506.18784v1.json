      "content": "\\label{rem:every_group_is_syndetic_decomposable}\nBella and Malykhin \\cite{BellaMalykhin99} asked if every discrete group can be partitioned into two syndetic sets. For instance, in the group of integers, the even and odd numbers form such a partition --- both are syndetic, as they are translations of a finite index subgroup. Although Protasov \\cite{Protasov03} later provided an ad hoc solution, a more conceptual answer was already implicit in earlier work by Balcar and Franek \\cite{BalcarFranek97}, in their study of the universal minimal space of a semigroup.\n\nLet us briefly describe this approach in the setting of groups. A \\define{minimal} $G$-space is a compact Hausdorff space equipped with a continuous action of $G$ such that it contains no proper nonempty closed $G$-invariant subsets. Every group $G$ admits a {\\em universal} minimal $G$-space --- one through which every other minimal $G$-space factors. If $G$ is countable discrete, then this universal minimal space is nontrivial totally (in fact, extremally) disconnected space.\n\nThe collection of clopen subsets of this universal space hence forms a nontrivial $G$-Boolean algebra. It is a fact that this algebra is isomorphic to an invariant Boolean subalgebra of the power set of $G$ (with $G$ acting by left translations), which is maximal with respect to the property that every nontrivial subset in this collection is syndetic. In particular, this implies the existence of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that both $A$ and its complement $G \\setminus A$ are syndetic. For more details, see \\cite{BalcarFranek97}. \n\nIn a similar spirit, Kennedy, Raum, and Salomon studied the universal minimal proximal $G$-space \\cite{KenRaumSal22}. A $G$-space is said to be \\define{proximal} if for any two points $x$ and $y$ in the space, there exists a net $(g_\\alpha)$ in $G$ such that $\\lim g_\\alpha x = \\lim g_\\alpha y$. As with the minimal case, there exists a universal minimal proximal $G$-space, which is totally (in fact, extremally) disconnected. The $G$-Boolean algebra of its clopen subsets is isomorphic to a $G$-invariant Boolean subalgebra of the power set of $G$, and is maximal with respect to the property that every nontrivial element is {\\em completely syndetic}.\n\nA notable difference from the minimal setting is that this Boolean algebra can be trivial; such groups are called \\define{strongly amenable}. This occurs precisely when $G$ has no nontrivial ICC quotient\n(\\ie no nontrivial quotient with the property that every nontrivial conjugacy class is infinite). In the case where $G$ is finitely generated, this is equivalent to $G$ being virtually nilpotent. For further discussion, see \\cite{FriTamVa18}.",

In fact, this is the origin of the term {\\em syndetic}.\n\nWe can also give a direct proof: If $A$ is syndetic, there exists a finite set $F_1 \\subset \\Z$ such that for every $z \\in \\Z$, some $f \\in F_1$ satisfies $z + f \\in A$. Now suppose, toward a contradiction, that $\\sup_n \\beta_n = \\infty$.

Therefore, $\\sup_n \\beta_n(A^+) < \\infty$.   \n\nConversely, if both $A^+$ and $A^-$ are in $\\Omega$ and both $\\sup_n \\beta_n(A^+)$ and $\\sup_n\\beta_n(A^-)$ are finite, choose some \n$b \\geq \\sup_n \\{ \\beta_n(A^+) , \\beta_n(A^-) \\}$.\n\nFix $z \\in \\N$.

Thus we can conclude that for every $z \\in \\N$, there exists $f \\in {0, 1, \\ldots, b}$ such that $z + f \\in A^+$.\n\nA similar argument applied to $A^-$ shows that for every $z \\in \\N$, there exists $f \\in \\{-b,-b+1, \\ldots, 0\\}$ such that $-z + f \\in A^-$.\n\nSo, for every $z \\in \\Z$, there exists $f \\in F_1 := \\{-b, -b+1, \\ldots, b\\}$ such that $z + f \\in A$, and so $A$ is syndetic.",

On the other hand, if $G$ is not virtually nilpotent, then the existence of infinitely many disjoint $\\CS$ sets implies that any subadditive function from the power set of $G$ into the unit interval $[0,1]$ (and, in particular, an upper density relative to {\\em any} sequence) attains arbitrarily small values on some $\\CS$ set.
