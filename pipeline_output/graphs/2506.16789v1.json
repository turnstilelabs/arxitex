      "proof": "Let $C_0'$ be the constant of   \\fullref{Oh}  with respect to $L$\n  and $A$. \n  Let $C_0:=\\max\\{C_0',2L+A\\}$.\n  Consider $g\\Sigma_S$ for $g\\in G_\\Upsilon$ and $S\\in\n  \\compliant_\\Upsilon^0$.\n  If $S$ is the vertex set of a maximal (thick) join of $\\Upsilon$\n  then  \\fullref{Oh}   and \\fullref{Oh:standard} combine to say there\n  exist $g'\\in G'$ and $S'$ the vertex set of a maximal (thick) join\n  of $\\Upsilon'$ such that $d_{Haus}(\\phi(g\\Sigma_S),g'\\Sigma_{S'})\\leq C'_0\\leq C_0$.\n  By definition $S'\\in\\compliant_{\\Upsilon'}^0$.\n  If $S$ is such that $G_S$ is finite then the diameter of $\\Sigma_S$\n  is 0 if $G_\\Upsilon$ is a RAAG or at most 2 if $G_\\Upsilon$ is a\n  2--dimensional RACG.\n  Thus, for any $g'\\in G_{\\Upsilon'}$ such that\n  $g'\\Sigma_\\emptyset\\in\\phi(g\\Sigma_S)$ we have $\\emptyset\n  \\in\\compliant_{\\Upsilon'}^0$ and \n  $d_{Haus}(\\phi(g\\Sigma_S),g'\\Sigma_\\emptyset)\\leq 2L+A\\leq C_0$.\n  In the RAAG case this is all of $\\compliant_\\Upsilon^0$.\n  In the RACG case it is also all of $\\compliant_\\Upsilon^0$, since\n  the triangle-free hypothesis implies that we cannot add a cone\n  vertex to a maximal thick join. \n  \n  Now induct on index: supposing the proposition is true for all indices up to\n  and including $n$, we extend it to $n+1$.  \n\nInduction step \\ref{item:projection} corresponds to projection between\nsubcomplexes.\nSuppose $S:=S_0\\cap S_1\\cap\\bigcap_{t\\in\n  T}\\lk(t)\\in\\compliant_\\Upsilon^{n+1}$ for some $S_0,S_1\\in\n\\compliant_\\Upsilon^n$ and $T$ either empty or not contained in either\nof $S_0$ or $S_1$.\nIf $T=\\emptyset$ define $h=1\\in G_\\Upsilon$.\nThen $S=S_0\\cap S_1$, so\n$\\Sigma_S=\\Sigma_{S_0}\\cap\\Sigma_{S_1}=\\pi_{\\Sigma_{S_0}}(h\\Sigma_{S_1})$. \nIf $T\\neq\\emptyset$ then there exists $t_0\\in T\\setminus S_0$ and\n$t_1\\in T\\setminus S_1$.\nLet $h\\in G_\\Upsilon$ be any shortest word that begins with $t_0$ and\nends with $t_1$ and uses every letter in $T$ at least once.\nSo $|h|=|T|$ if $|T|=1$ or $t_0\\neq t_1$, and $|h|=|T|+1$ if $|T|>1$\nbut $t_0=t_1$.\nAgain we have $\\Sigma_S=\\pi_{\\Sigma_{S_0}}(h\\Sigma_{S_1})$.\nDefine $h_0:=1\\in G_\\Upsilon$ and $h_1:=h$. \n\nBy the induction hypothesis, for every $g\\in G_\\Upsilon$ and every\n$(L,A)$--quasiisometry $\\phi\\from\n\\Sigma_\\Upsilon\\to\\Sigma_{\\Upsilon'}$ there are\n$S_0',S_1'\\in\\compliant_{\\Upsilon'}^n$ and $g_0',g_1'\\in\nG_{\\Upsilon'}$ such that:\n\\[d_{Haus}(\\phi(gh_i\\Sigma_{S_i}),g_i'\\Sigma_{S_i'})\\leq C_n\\]\n\nLet $g'$ be a shortest element of $G_{S_0'}((g_0')^{-1}g_1')G_{S_1'}$, so\n$|g'|=d_{\\Sigma_{\\Upsilon'}}(g_0'\\Sigma_{S_0'},g_1'\\Sigma_{S_1'})$\nand if $g'$ is nontrivial then it begins with a letter not in $S_0'$ and ends with a letter not\nin $S_1'$.\nLet $T'$ be the letters appearing in $g'$, so that for $S':=S_0'\\cap\nS_1'\\cap\\bigcap_{t\\in T'}\\lk(t)\\in \\compliant_{\\Upsilon'}^{n+1}$ we\nhave $g_0'\\Sigma_{S'}=\\pi_{g_0'\\Sigma_{S_0'}}(g_1'\\Sigma_{S_1'})$.\n\n\\fullref{coarse_intersection_in_cube_cpx} says\n$g\\Sigma_S=g\\pi_{\\Sigma_{S_0}}(h\\Sigma_{S_1})\\ceq(g\\Sigma_{S_0}\\cint\ngh\\Sigma_{S_1})$, and \\fullref{qi_preserves_coarse_intersection} says $\\phi$ sends this\ncoarse intersection \nto within bounded Hausdorff distance of $\\phi(g\\Sigma_{S_0})\\cint\n\\phi(gh\\Sigma_{S_1})$.\nBut using the induction hypothesis and\n\\fullref{coarse_intersection_in_cube_cpx} gives:\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\phi(g\\Sigma_{S_0})\\cint\n  \\phi(gh\\Sigma_{S_1})&\\ceq g_0'\\Sigma_{S_0'}\\cint g_1'\\Sigma_{S_1'}\\\\\n                     &\\ceq \\pi_{g_0'\\Sigma_{S_0'}}(g_1'\\Sigma_{S_1'})\\\\\n  &=g_0'\\Sigma_{S'}\n\\end{align*}\nMoreover, the coarse equivalences provided by\n\\fullref{coarse_intersection_in_cube_cpx} and\n\\fullref{qi_preserves_coarse_intersection} depend on $L$ and $A$ and\nthe distances between the sets of the coarse intersections, so on \n$d(g\\Sigma_{S_0},gh\\Sigma_{S_1})=|h|\\leq |T|+1\\leq\n|\\Upsilon|+1$ and on:\n\\[d(g_0'\\Sigma_{S_0'},g_1'\\Sigma_{S_1'})\\leq\n  2C_n+d(\\phi(g\\Sigma_{S_0}),\\phi(gh\\Sigma_{S_1}))\\leq\n  2C_n+A+L(|\\Upsilon|+1)\\]\nThus,  $d_{Haus}(\\phi(g\\Sigma_S),g'\\Sigma_{S'})$ is bounded by a\nconstant $C_{n+1}'$ depending on $L$, $A$, $C_n$, and\n$|\\Upsilon|$, hence on $L$, $A$, $N$, and $n$. \n\n\nFor induction step \\ref{item:pole}, \n  suppose that $S_0\\in\\compliant_\\Upsilon^{n+1}$ is obtained from\n  $S\\in\\compliant_\\Upsilon^n$ by virtue of $S$ decomposing as $S=S_0\\sqcup S_1$, with $S_0\\join S_1\\subset\\Upsilon$ where \n  $\\Sigma_{S_0}$ is line and $\\Sigma_{S_1}$ is a bushy tree.\n  By the induction hypothesis, for every $g\\in G_\\Upsilon$ and every $(L,A)$--quasiisometry $\\phi\\from\n  \\Sigma_\\Upsilon\\to\\Sigma_{\\Upsilon'}$ there are $g'\\in\n  G_{\\Upsilon'}$ and $S'\\in\\compliant^n_{\\Upsilon'}$ such that $d_{Haus}(\\phi(g\\Sigma_{S}),g'\\Sigma_{S'})\\leq C_n$.\n  Then\n  $\\pi_{g'\\Sigma_{S'}}\\circ\\phi|_{g\\Sigma_{S}}$\n  is a quasiisometry from a $\\text{(bounded valence bushy\n    tree)}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ to $g'\\Sigma_{S'}$ whose quasiisometry\n  constants depend only on $L$, $A$, and $C_n$.\n  Thus, $\\Davis_{S'}$ is also a $\\text{(bounded valence bushy\n    tree)}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, which implies $S'=S_0'\\sqcup S_1'$, where\n  $S_0'\\join S_1'\\subset\\Upsilon'$, with \n  $\\Sigma_{S_0'}$ a line and $\\Sigma_{S_1'}$ a bushy tree.\n  Thus, $S_0'\\in\\compliant_{\\Upsilon'}^{n+1}$.\n  Furthermore, \n  since the $\\mathbb{R}$--factor defines the only coarse equivalence\n  class of separating quasiline in a $\\text{(bounded valence bushy\n    tree)}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, it follows from  \\cite{Pap05} that up to\n  post-composition by an element of $G_{S_1'}$, we have that $g\\Sigma_{S_0}$ is sent $C''_{n+1}$--Hausdorff close to\n  $g'\\Sigma_{S_0'}$, with $C''_{n+1}$ depending on $L$, $A$, and $C_n$,\n  hence on $L$, $A$, $N$, and $n$.\n\n  In the RAAG case this is all of $\\compliant_\\Upsilon^{n+1}$.\n  In the RACG case the Recursive~Phase allows for the possibility of\n  taking joins with spherical subsets, which, since $n+1>0$ and\n  $\\Upsilon$ is triangle-free, simply means adding or removing a cone\n  vertex. \n\\fullref{cor:joinclique} says \nthat if $S_0\\join S_1\\subset\\Upsilon$ and $S_0'\\join\n  S_1\\subset\\Upsilon$ with $\\Davis_{S_0}$ and $\\Davis_{S_0'}$ finite\n  then $\\Davis_{S_1}$, $\\Davis_{S_0\\join S_1}$,  $\\Davis_{S_0'\\join\n    S_1}$ are pairwise at Hausdorff distance at most 2.\n  Suppose we know that one of these sets is in\n  $\\compliant_\\Upsilon^{n+1}$ by one of the previous constructions, so its $\\phi$--image is\n$\\max\\{C_{n+1}',C_{n+1}''\\}$ close to some $g'\\Davis_{S'}$ for $g'\\in\nG_{\\Upsilon'}$ and $S'\\in\\compliant_{\\Upsilon'}^n$.\nThen the\n$\\phi$--images of the other two are within\nHausdorff distance $2L+A+\\max\\{C_{n+1}',C_{n+1}''\\}$ of the same\n$g'\\Davis_{S'}$. \n\nWe have shown it suffices to take\n$C_{n+1}:=2L+A+\\max\\{C_{n+1}',C_{n+1}''\\}$.\n\nFor the further statement, in a RAAG there are no nontrivial spherical\nsubsets so there is no Recursive~Phase, only operations \\ref{item:projection} and\n\\ref{item:pole} of the Inductive~Phase of \\fullref{def:constructible_compliant}  apply, and these both\ndecrease the size of the sets involved, \nso the sequence $\\compliant_\\Upsilon^0\\subset \\compliant_\\Upsilon^1\\subset\\cdots$\nstabilizes after a number of steps bounded above by the size of \nlargest set in $\\compliant_\\Upsilon^0$, which is the largest join in\n$\\Upsilon$, whose size is at most $|\\Upsilon|\\leq N$.\nIn a RACG we can add a cone vertex, increasing the size of a compliant\nset without changing its index.\nFor operation \\ref{item:pole}, it takes at least three generators to make a bushy tree, so\nif $\\Sigma_{S_0}$ is a line and $\\Sigma_{S_1}$ is a bushy tree and\n$\\Sigma_{S_0*S_1}$ is compliant then $S_0$ is compliant and contains fewer elements\nthan $S_0\\sqcup S_1$, and a cone on $S_0$ is also compliant and\ncontains fewer elements than $S_0\\sqcup S_1$.\n\nNow consider the case that $S_0,S_1\\in\\compliant^n_\\Upsilon$ and\n$S:=S_0\\cap S_1\\cap\\bigcap_{t\\in T}\\lk(t)\\in\\compliant^{n+1}_\\Upsilon\\setminus\\compliant^n_\\Upsilon$\nand $S'=S\\join\\{c\\}$ is a cone on $S$.\nSince $\\Upsilon$ is triangle-free, $S$ is an anticlique. \nSuppose $|S'|\\geq |S_0|$ and $|S'|\\geq |S_1|$.\nNeither of these can be strict, since $S\\notin\\compliant_\\Upsilon^n$\nimplies $S\\subsetneq S_0$ and $S\\subsetneq S_1$. \nSo $S_0=S\\cup\\{a_0\\}$ and $S_1=S\\cup\\{a_1\\}$.\nFurthermore, $S\\notin\\compliant_\\Upsilon^n$ implies $a_i$ is not a\ncone vertex of $S_i$, which implies $S_i$ contains no cone vertex,\nsince $S$ is an anticlique. \nThus, we entertain the notion that $|S'|=|S_0|=|S_1|$, but such an\ninconvenience does not \npropagate any further, since this $S'$ having a\ncone vertex means it cannot be the $S_0$ or\n$S_1$ in an iterate of this paragraph.\nThus, we conclude that the size of a set in\n$\\compliant_\\Upsilon^{n+2}$ is strictly less than the sets of\n$\\compliant_\\Upsilon^n$ from which it is derived. Thus, \n$\\compliant_\\Upsilon=\\compliant_\\Upsilon^{2N}$."

In particular, all of the squares in $\\Gamma$ survive as squares in $\\Gamma'$.\n  Some vertices of $\\Delta$ may get identified, but those that do\n  come from different feet, so they have distance at least 6 in $\\Delta$; \n  thus, all of the squares of $\\Delta$ survive as squares in\n  $\\Gamma'$, and we did not create any triangles.\n\n\n By construction, every vertex of $\\Gamma'$ lies in a square, so to establish that $\\Gamma'$ is strongly CFS, it is enough to show that $\\diag(\\Gamma')$ is connected.\nSince $\\Delta$ is strongly CFS, we conclude that vertices of\n$\\diag(\\Gamma')$ that are the diagonal of a square with edges only\nfrom $\\Gamma$ or only from $\\Delta$ are contained in a common\nconnected component of $\\diag(\\Gamma')$. \n  This leaves us to consider vertices of $\\diag(\\Gamma')$ coming from squares that use edges from\n  both $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$.\n  The only vertices of $\\Delta$ that attach to $\\Gamma$ and\n  are at distance less than $6$ from one another inside $\\Delta$ are the pincers of a\n  foot, so we may assume $a$ and $b$ are the pincers, and take $d_0$ and $d_1$ to be\n  their two common neighbors in $\\Delta$.\nBy construction, $\\{a,b\\}$ is also the diagonal of a square in\n$\\Gamma$, so $a$ and $b$ have common neighbors $c_0,c_1,\\dots$ in\n$\\Gamma$. \n For any $i$ and $j$, there is a square $\\{a,b\\}\\join\\{c_i,d_j\\}$ with\n $\\Gamma$--edges $c_i\\join\\{a,b\\}$ and $\\Delta$ edges\n $d_j\\join\\{a,b\\}$.\n We have that $\\{c_i,d_j\\}$ is a vertex of $\\diag(\\Gamma')$ that does\n not occur in either $\\diag(\\Delta)$ or $\\diag(\\Gamma)$, but it is\n adjacent to the vertex $\\{a,b\\}$, which occurs in both.\n\n  The further claim about squares follows from the construction, as the `mixed'\n  squares with edges from $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ only occur when a\n  pincer foot attached to the diagonal of an existing square of $\\Gamma$."

So it is a proper, incomplete\n subgraph of $\\Gamma_i$. \n \n \n\n In Case B, supposing $\\Gamma_i$ has no cone vertex, we claim that both  $v$ and $w$ are adjacent to every\n vertex of $\\Gamma_i$ and define $\\Delta_{i+1}:=\\Delta_i'$ and\n $\\Gamma_{i+1}:=\\Gamma_i \\join v$.\n By construction, $\\Gamma_i$ is not a clique.\n \n To see the claim, suppose, to the contrary, that there is a vertex\n $x$ of $\\Gamma_i$ that is not adjacent to $v$.\nSince $x$ is not a cone vertex of $\\Gamma_i$, there exist vertices of\n$\\Delta_i'$ with support containing $x$.\nWe may assume $x$ and $\\{x,y\\}\\in\\Delta_i'$ have been chosen such that\nthat  $\\{x,y\\}$ is a closest vertex to $\\{e,f\\}$\n in $\\Delta_i'$ among those whose support contains a vertex not\n adjacent to $v$ or $w$. \n Take a geodesic\n $\\{e,f\\}=\\{e_0,f_0\\}$, $\\{e_1,f_1\\}$,\\dots, $\\{e_n,f_n\\}=\\{x,y\\}$ in\n $\\diag(\\Gamma)$.\n The `closest' hypothesis implies that for $j<n$ both of $e_j$ and $f_j$ are adjacent\nto both of \n $v$ and $w$,\nso $\\{v,w\\}\\edge \\{e_j,f_j\\}$ is an edge in\n $\\diag(\\Gamma)$.\n Thus, by replacing $\\{e,f\\}$ with $\\{e_{n-1},f_{n-1}\\}$, we may assume $\\{x,y\\}$ and $\\{e,f\\}$ are adjacent in\n $\\diag(\\Gamma)$.\n But this gives a join $\\{v,w,x,y\\}\\join\\{e,f\\}$ in $\\Gamma$ with $v$ not adjacent to $x$, yielding an induced square\n $\\{v,x\\}*\\{e,f\\}$ in $\\Gamma$,\n which is a contradiction, because in that case \n $\\{v,x\\}$ is available for Case A.\n\n Notice that after performing a Case B extension, the vertex $\\{v,w\\}$\n has $v\\in\\Gamma_{i+1}$ and $w\\notin\\Gamma_{i+1}$, so the subsequent\n inductive step will be a Case A extension.\n This justifies the supposition that $\\Gamma_i$ has no cone vertex\n when Case B is applied. \n\nWe now check that if the induction hypotheses are true up to stage $i$\nthen they are true at $i+1$.\nSince the $\\Gamma_i$ are induced subgraphs of $\\Gamma$, their diagonal\ngraphs are subgraphs of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$.\n\nSuppose $\\Gamma_i$ was obtained from\n$\\Gamma_{i-1}$ by a Case B extension.\nSince we never perform consecutive Case B extensions, the support of\n$\\Delta_{i-1}$ is all of $\\Gamma_{i-1}$, so the support of $\\Delta_i$\nis all of $\\Gamma_i$ except the cone vertex added in the last\nextension. \n\n Suppose $\\Gamma_i$ is obtained by a Case A extension and\n $\\Gamma_{i-1}$ has no cone vertex.\n Let $\\{v,w\\}$ and $\\{e,f\\}$ be as in the description of Case A. \n Since $\\Gamma_{i-1}$ has no cone vertex, $\\Delta_{i-1}$ has support\n all of $\\Gamma_{i-1}$.\n Since $\\Delta_i$ contains $\\Delta_{i-1}$ and $\\{v,w\\}$, its support\n contains all vertices of $\\Gamma_i$.\n\n Finally, suppose $\\Gamma_{i-1}$ has a cone vertex.\n This occurs when $\\Gamma_{i-1}$ is constructed from $\\Gamma_{i-2}$ by\n a Case B extension.\n Let $\\{v,w\\}$ and $\\{e,f\\}$ be as in the description of Case B, so\n that $\\Gamma_{i-1}=\\Gamma_{i-2}\\join v$ and $\\Gamma_i$ is obtained from\n $\\Gamma_{i-1}$ by coning-off the proper subgraph $\\Gamma_{i-2}\n \\subset \\Gamma_{i-1}$ to $w$.\nSince we never perform consecutive Case B extensions, the support of\n$\\Delta_{i-2}$ contains all vertices of $\\Gamma_{i-2}$.\nSince $\\Delta_i$ contains $\\Delta_{i-2}$ and $\\{v,w\\}$, its support is\nall vertices of $\\Gamma_i$."

      "proof": "If $\\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of connected components of\n  $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ and $\\Delta$ is a subgraph of $\\Gamma$, \n  let $\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$ be the span of\n  $\\bigcup_{C\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\supp(C)$ in $\\Gamma$ and let $\\Psi(\\Delta)$ be the\n  collection of connected components $C$ of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ such that\n  $\\Delta$ contains an induced square with vertices in $\\supp(C)$.\nWe claim that $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ give inverse bijections between the\nset of minsquare subgraphs of $\\Gamma$ and collections of connected\ncomponents of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ satisfying the conditions in the statement of the lemma. \n  \nSince $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ has no isolated vertices, $\\mathcal{C}$ is\nnonempty if and only if $\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$ contains an induced square\nof $\\Gamma$, and $\\Delta$ contains an induced square of $\\Gamma$ if\nand only if $\\Psi(\\Delta)$ is a nonempty collection.\n\nNow we want to show that Condition~\\eqref{item:square_complete}\ndescribes square completeness. \nIf $\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies Condition~\\eqref{item:square_complete} then whenever\n$\\{v,w\\}\\subset\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$ is a vertex of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$\ncontained in a connected component $C_0$, we have $C_0\\in\\mathcal{C}$.\nSince $C_0$ is a connected component of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$, every vertex \nadjacent to $\\{v,w\\}$ is also\ncontained in $C_0$, so every induced square of $\\Gamma$ with\ndiagonal $\\{v,w\\}$ is contained in $\\supp(C_0)\\subset\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$.\nThus, $\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$ is square complete.\n\nConversely, if $\\Delta$ is a square complete subgraph of $\\Gamma$ and\nif $\\{v,w\\}\\subset \\Delta$ is a vertex of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ contained in\nconnected component $C_0$, then every neighbor $\\{x,y\\}$ of\n$\\{v,w\\}$, of which there is at least one, corresponds to an induced\nsquare $\\{v,w\\}\\join\\{x,y\\}$ of $\\Gamma$.\nBy square completeness, $\\{x,y\\}\\subset\\Delta$, so\n$C_0\\in\\Psi(\\Delta)$.\nFurthermore, by induction on distance to $\\{v,w\\}$ in $C_0$,\n$\\supp(C_0)\\subset\\Delta$.\nApplying this reasoning to each component in $\\Psi(\\Delta)$, we see that\n$\\Phi(\\Psi(\\Delta))\\subset\\Delta$. \nThis shows that $\\Psi(\\Delta)$ satisfies Condition~\\eqref{item:square_complete}, as follows.  If \n$\\{v,w\\}\\subset\\bigcup_{C\\in\\Psi(\\Delta)}\\supp(C)$ is a vertex of\n$\\diag(\\Gamma)$ contained in a component $C_0$, then  $\\{v, w\\} \\subset \\Delta$, since \n$\\bigcup_{C\\in\\Psi(\\Delta)}\\supp(C)$ induces the graph $\\Phi(\\Psi(\\Delta))\\subset \\Delta$, so by the first part of this paragraph, $C_0\\in\\Psi(\\Delta)$. \n\nNow observe that every collection $\\mathcal C$ satisfying $(2)$ fulfills $\\Psi(\\Phi(\\mathcal{C}))=\\mathcal{C}$. Indeed, $C_0\\in \\Psi(\\Phi(\\mathcal{C}))$ means that\n$\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$ contains an induced square with vertices in\n$\\supp(C_0)$, so Condition~\\eqref{item:square_complete} gives\n$C_0\\in\\mathcal{C}$, ie.\\ $\\Psi(\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})) \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{C}$.\nConversely, if $C_0 \\in \\mathcal C$ then $C_0 \\in \\Phi(\\supp(C_0))$, hence, $C_0\\in \\Psi(\\supp(C_0))\\subseteq \\Psi(\\Phi(\\mathcal C))$.\n\n Finally, we show that Condition~\\eqref{item:minimality} is the\n analogue of the minimality condition in the definition of minsquare. \nSuppose $\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies all three conditions, and define\n$\\Delta:=\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$.\nBy the previous two steps of the argument, $\\Delta$ is square complete and contains a square. \nSuppose that $\\Delta'$ is a square complete subgraph of $\\Delta$\nthat contains a square.\nThen $\\Psi(\\Delta')$ is a subcollection of $\\Psi(\\Delta)$\nthat satisfies the first two conditions, so by minimality\n$\\Psi(\\Delta')=\\Psi(\\Delta)$. \nNow:\n\\[\\Delta'\\subset\n  \\Delta=\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})=\\Phi(\\Psi(\\Delta))=\\Phi(\\Psi(\\Delta'))\\subset\\Delta'\\]\nThus, $\\Delta$ is square complete and contains a square, and there is\nno proper subgraph of $\\Delta$ with both properties, so $\\Delta$ is\nminsquare.\n\nConversely, if $\\Delta$ is minsquare then it is square complete and\ncontains a square, so $\\Psi(\\Delta)$ is a \ncollection of connected components of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ that satisfies\nthe first two conditions.\nSuppose $\\mathcal{C}$ is a subcollection of $\\Psi(\\Delta)$\nsatisfying the first two conditions.\nThen $\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})$ is a square complete subgraph of $\\Delta$ that\ncontains a square.\nBy minimality of $\\Delta$, we have $\\Phi(\\mathcal{C})=\\Delta$. \nBut then $\\mathcal{C}\\subset\\Psi(\\Delta)=\\Psi(\\Phi(\\mathcal{C}))=\\mathcal{C}$.\nThus, $\\Psi(\\Delta)$ is minimal with respect to inclusion among\ncollections of components of $\\diag(\\Gamma)$ satisfying the first two\nconditions."

Then $s\\Act v\\neq v$\n        but $s$ fixes vertices in $R_0\\setminus\\{v\\}$ and\n        $R_1\\setminus\\{v\\}$.\n        Let $\\gamma$ be a shortest path in $\\ric_\\Gamma$ from the\n        fixed set of $s$ in $R_0$ to the fixed set of $s$ in $R_1$.\n        Since $v$ separates $R_0$ from\n        $R_1$ in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$, $\\gamma$ goes through\n        $v$.\n        The path $s\\Act\\gamma$ does not go through $v$, since $s\\Act\n        v\\neq v$, and it has the same endpoints as $\\gamma$, so it connects $R_0$ to $R_1$ in\n        $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ and avoids $v$.\n        \n\n        The other way for \\eqref{item:ric_not_in_one_component} to\n        fail is if there is an edge of $\\Gamma$ from a vertex $s_0\\in\n        \\Gamma_0\\setminus \\Gamma_1$ to a vertex\n        $s_1\\in\\Gamma_1\\setminus\\Gamma_0$.\n        By construction, this means there are vertices $u_i\\in\n        R_i\\setminus \\{v\\}$ such that $s_i\\in J_{u_i}\\setminus J_v$.\n        Furthermore, $s_0,s_1\\notin J_v$ implies $W_{\\{s_0,s_1\\}}\\cap\n        W_{J_v}=\\{1\\}$. \n        Let $\\gamma$ be a minimal length path in $\\ric_\\Gamma$\n        from $u_0$ to $u_1$.\n        The concatenation of  $s_0\\Act\\gamma$, $s_1s_0\\Act\\gamma=s_0s_1\\Act\\gamma$, and\n        $s_1\\Act\\gamma$ connects $R_0$ and $R_1$ in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ and\n        avoids $v$.\n\n\n\n        Suppose $v$ does not separate $\\ric_\\Gamma$ in\n        $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n       Then there is some\n        translate $w\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$ such that $\\ric_\\Gamma\\cap\n        w\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma=\\{v\\}$ and $v$ separates\n        $\\ric_\\Gamma$ from $w\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$\n        in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n        We induct on the word length of $w$ after considering what\n        happens for generators. \n        Consider $s\\in J_v$ not satisfying\n        \\eqref{item:ric_in_one_component}, so either $s$ fixes a\n        vertex $u_s\\in \\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$, or $s$ only fixes\n        $v$ but is adjacent in\n        $\\Gamma$ to a vertex $t$ that fixes $u_t\\in\n        \\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$ but does not fix $v$.\n        We claim in both cases that $v$ does not separate\n        $\\ric_\\Gamma$ and $s\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$\n        in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n        In the first case $v\\neq u_s\\in\\ric_\\Gamma\\cap s\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$.\n        In the second case take a shortest path $\\gamma$ in $\\ric_\\Gamma$ from\n        $v$ to $u_t$.\n        Then $t\\Act\\gamma$ contains $u_t$ and $t\\Act v$ but not $v$, and\n        $st\\Act\\gamma$ contains $s\\Act u_t\\in s\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$ and\n        $st\\Act v=ts\\Act v=t\\Act v$ but not $s\\Act v=v$.\n        Thus, there is a path in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ from\n        $s\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$ to $\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$\n        that avoids $\\{v\\}$.\n        Now write $w$ as a minimal length word $s_1\\cdots s_n$ for\n        $s_i\\in J_v$.\n        If every $s_i\\in J_v$ fails to satisfy\n        \\eqref{item:ric_in_one_component} then every pair\n        $\\ric_\\Gamma$ and $s_i\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$\n        are not separated by $v$ in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n        But then $s_1\\cdots s_i\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$ is not separated from\n        $s_1\\cdots s_is_{i+1}\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$ by $v$ in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$, so all of $\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$,\n        $s_1\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$,\\dots,$s_1\\cdots\n        s_n\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}=w\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$ are\n        in the same component of $\\mprg_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$,\n        contradicting the choice of $w$.\n        Thus, there is some $s\\in J_v$ satisfying\n        \\eqref{item:ric_in_one_component}.\n\n        In the other direction we suppose\n        \\eqref{item:ric_not_in_one_component} or\n        \\eqref{item:ric_in_one_component} and produce a cut\n        vertex  $v$  of $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n\n        First suppose  \\eqref{item:ric_not_in_one_component}.\n        Consider the splitting\n        $W_\\Gamma=W_{\\Gamma_0}*_{W_{J_v}}W_{\\Gamma_1}$.\n        Let $T$ be its Bass-Serre tree.\n        Edges of $T$ belong to a single orbit and they are in bijection\n        with  cosets of $W_{J_v}$.\n        There are two orbits of vertices in $T$ corresponding to\n        cosets of $W_{\\Gamma_0}$ and $W_{\\Gamma_1}$.\n        We define a\n        $W_\\Gamma$--equivariant map $\\phi\\from\n       W_\\Gamma\\times\\ric_\\Gamma\\to\n       \\mathrm{Vertices}(T)\\cup\\mathrm{Edges}(T)$  and then check it\n       actually defines a map on $\\mprg_\\Gamma=W_\\Gamma\\Act\\ric_\\Gamma$. \n        \\[\\phi(w\\Act u):=\n          \\begin{cases}\n            \\text{the vertex } wW_{\\Gamma_0}&\\text{if } u\\in R_0\\setminus\\{v\\}\\\\\n            \\text{the vertex } wW_{\\Gamma_1}&\\text{if } u\\in\n            R_1\\setminus \\{v\\}\\\\\n            \\text{the edge } wW_{J_v}&\\text{if\n            }u=v\n          \\end{cases}\n        \\]\n        Suppose $u\\in R_0\\setminus \\{v\\}$ and $w'\\!\\Act u=w\\Act u$.\n        Then $w'\\in\n        wW_{J_u}\\subset wW_{\\Gamma_0}$, so\n        $\\phi(w\\Act u)=wW_{\\Gamma_0}=w'W_{\\Gamma_0}=\\phi(w'\\!\\Act u)$.\n        Similar arguments hold for $R_1\\setminus \\{v\\}$ and $v$, so\n        $\\phi$ is well-defined on vertices of $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n\n        Every edge in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ is a translate of one in\n        $\\ric_\\Gamma$ (recall \\fullref{weakconvexity}), so it can be written $w\\Act u_0\\edge w\\Act u_1$ where\n        $u_0\\edge u_1\\subset \\ric_\\Gamma$. \n        If $u_0,u_1$ are both in $R_0\\setminus\\{v\\}$ or both in\n        $R_1\\setminus\\{v\\}$ then they map to the same vertex of $T$. \n       If $u\\in R_i$ is adjacent to $v$ then\n       $\\phi(v)=1W_{J_v}$ is an edge incident to the\n       vertex $\\phi(u)=1W_{\\Gamma_i}$.\n       By hypothesis, there are no edges between a vertex of\n       $R_0\\setminus\\{v\\}$ and a vertex of $R_1\\setminus\\{v\\}$.\n       Conclude that edge paths in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ are sent by $\\phi$ to\n       connected subsets of $T$.\n        \n        Consider the edge of $T$ corresponding to the coset\n        $1W_{\\Gamma_0\\cap\\Gamma_1}$.\n        Its two vertices are $1W_{\\Gamma_0}$ and $1W_{\\Gamma_1}$.\n        Consider any path in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ from a vertex of\n        $R_0\\setminus\\{v\\}$ to a\n        vertex of\n        $R_1\\setminus\\{v\\}$.\n        Its $\\phi$--image is a connected set in $T$ that contains\n        $1W_{\\Gamma_0}$ and $1W_{\\Gamma_1}$, so  it contains a vertex\n        $w\\Act u$ such that $\\phi(w\\Act u)$ is the edge $1W_{J_v}$.\n        The definition of $\\phi$ requires  $u=v$ and\n        $wW_{J_v}=1W_{J_v}$, so\n        $w\\in W_{J_v}$, which  gives $w\\Act v=v$.\n        Thus, every path in $\\mprg_\\Gamma$ from\n        $R_0\\setminus\\{v\\}$ to $R_1\\setminus\\{v\\}$ passes through $v$,\n        so $v$ is a cut vertex of $\\mprg_\\Gamma$.\n\n        Now suppose  \\eqref{item:ric_in_one_component}.\n        Let $\\gamma\\from [0,L]\\to\\mprg_\\Gamma$ be a combinatorial path from \n        $\\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$ to \n        $s\\Act \\ric_\\Gamma\\setminus\\{v\\}$, and let $\\gamma'$ be a path\n        from 1 to $s$ in $\\Davis_\\Gamma$ shadowing it.\n        Since $\\gamma'$ starts and ends on opposite sides of the wall $\\wall_s$\n        dual to the edge $1\\edge s$, it contains some edge crossing\n        $\\wall_s$.\n        The condition of \\eqref{item:ric_in_one_component} saying $s$\n        is not contained in any other maximal thick join implies that\n        $\\Davis_{J_v}$ is the only maximal standard product subcomplex\n        containing the edge $1\\edge s$. \n        The condition that $\\lk(s)\\subset J_v$ implies that every\n        square containing the edge $1\\edge s$ is contained in\n        $\\Davis_{J_v}$.\n        It follows that every edge crossing $\\wall_s$ is contained in\n        $\\Davis_{J_v}$ and not in any other maximal standard product\n        subcomplex, so $\\gamma'$ can only cross $\\wall_s$ if $v\\in\\gamma$. Thus, $v$ is a cut vertex of $\\mprg_\\Gamma$."

$W_\\Gamma$ is $(\\X_0,\n \\mathfrak{S})$, where $\\mathfrak{S}$ is the projection closure\n of hyperplane carriers, and for $S\\in\\mathfrak{S}$, the hyperbolic\n space $CS$ associated to $S$ is its contact graph.\n To construct $ABD(G)$, Abbott, Behrstock, and Durham modify this HHS\n structure \\cite[Theorem~3.7]{AbbBehDur21} by replacing the top level\n hyperbolic space as follows.\n Start with $\\X_0$.\n For $S\\in \\mathfrak{S}$ not the maximal element, if there exists $T,U\\in\\mathfrak{S}$\n with $S\\subset T$ and $T\\perp U$ with both $CT$ and $CU$ of infinite\n diameter, then cone off $S$ by adding a new vertex $c_S$ attached to\n each vertex of $S$.\n The resulting space is $\\X_1:=ABD(W_\\Gamma)$.\n\nThe inclusion map $\\iota\\from\\X_2\\to\\X_1$ is \n$W_\\Gamma$--equivariant and Lipschitz.\nThe idea for showing it is a quasiisometry is that while there may be more cone vertices in $\\X_1$, the\nextra ones are coning off subsets of $\\X_0$  that were already coned off in $\\X_2$,\nso they are not making much difference. \nTo see this precisely, we will define a coarse inverse $\\bar\\iota\\from\n\\X_1\\to\\X_2$ to be the\nidentity on $\\X_0$ and extend it to $\\X_1\\setminus\\X_0$.\n\nFirst we characterize $S$ such that there is a cone vertex $c_S\\in\\X_1\\setminus\\X_0$.\nSuch a cone vertex comes from a convex subcomplex $S$ of some hyperplane carrier, for a\nhyperplane dual to edges labelled by some $s\\in \\Gamma$.\nUp to the $W_\\Gamma$--action, we may assume $1\\in S\\subset \\Davis_{\\st(s)}$\nAny $T$ containing $S$ is a convex subcomplex of the full hyperplane carrier  $\\Davis_{\\lk(s)}\\times\\Davis_{s}=\\Davis_{\\st(s)}$ with  $T\\subset \\Davis_{\\tau\\cup\\{s\\}}\\subset\\Davis_{\\st(s)}$, where\n$\\tau\\cup\\{s\\}$ is the set of edge labels that occur in $T$.\nNow, $\\Davis_{\\tau\\cup\\{s\\}}$ has unbounded associated hyperbolic space\nwhen $W_\\tau$ is infinite and not a product, which, since $\\Gamma$ is\ntriangle-free, is simply the case that $\\tau$ has at least two\nvertices. \nIn the other direction, if $U\\perp T$ then $U\\perp\n\\Davis_{\\tau\\cup\\{s\\}}$, but, by triangle-freeness, the biggest subcomplex perpendicular to\n$\\Davis_{\\tau\\cup\\{s\\}}$ is $\\Davis_\\upsilon$, where $\\upsilon$ is the\nset of common neighbors of $\\tau$. \nThis has infinite associated hyperbolic space when $\\upsilon$ has more\nthan one vertex.\nThus, we have a cone vertex $c_S\\in\\X_1$ when there exists a subset of\n$\\lk(s)$ that contains the non-$s$ edge labels in $S$, has at least 2\nvertices, and has at least one common neighbor other than $s$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that $S$ is contained in a standard product region.\n\nFor $c_S\\in\\X_1\\setminus\\X_0$ define $\\bar\\iota(c_S)$ to be the set of cone vertices $c_{S'}$ of $\\X_2$ such\nthat $S'$ is a maximal standard product region containing $S$.\nThen $\\bar\\iota\\circ\\iota=Id_{\\X_2}$, and we have\n$\\emptyset\\neq \\lk(c_S)\\subset \\bigcap_{c_{S'}\\in \\iota\\circ\\bar\\iota(c_S)} \\lk(c_{S'})$, which implies that  $\\iota\\circ\\bar\\iota$\nis at distance at most 2 from $Id_{\\X_1}$ and that distances between points\nin $\\X_0$ are the same in $\\X_1$ as in $\\X_2$.\nNow apply \\fullref{inversecoarselipimpliesqi} to see that $\\iota$ and\n$\\bar\\iota$ are inverse quasiisometries. \n\nDefine:\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\phi&\\from\\X_3\\to\\X_2\\from S\\mapsto c_S\\\\\n  \\bar\\phi&\\from \\X_2\\to\\X_3:\n  \\begin{cases}\n    c_S\\mapsto S&\\text{ for }c_S\\in \\X_2-\\X_0\\\\\n    x\\mapsto \\{ S\\mid x\\in S\\}&\\text{ for } x\\in\\X_0\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\nBy construction ,  $\\phi$ is $W_\\Gamma$--equivariant. \nIf distinct maximal standard product regions $S_1$ and $S_2$ intersect in a\nstandard flat $S_0$ then in $\\X_1$ there are cone vertices $c_{S_i}$\nwith $\\emptyset\\neq\\lk(c_{S_0})\\subset\\lk(c_{S_1})\\cap\\lk(c_{S_2})$,\nso $d_{\\X_2}(\\phi(S_1),\\phi(S_2))=d_{\\X_2}(c_{S_1},c_{S_2})=2$.\nSince $\\X_3$ is connected, by\n\\fullref{stronglycfsimpliesmprgconnected}, this implies $\\phi$ is 2--Lipschitz.\n\nThe maximal standard product regions containing 1 correspond to\nmaximal nontrivial joins in $\\Gamma$.\nThere are finitely many of these, and there do exist some, since the\nCFS property implies $\\Gamma$ contains a square.\nThus, $\\bar\\phi(1)$ is a non-empty set that is finite.\nSince $\\X_3$ is connected, finite sets have finite diameter.\nBy definition, $\\bar\\phi$ is $W_\\Gamma$--equivariant, so $\\bar\\phi$ is\na well defined map from $\\X_2$ to nonempty subsets of $\\X_3$ of\nuniformly bounded diameter.\nWhen $x\\in\\X_0$ and $c_S\\in\\X_2\\setminus\\X_0$ is an adjacent cone\nvertex then $x\\in S$, so $\\bar\\phi(c_S)\\in \\bar\\phi(x)$. \nSimilarly, the CFS property implies that for adjacent vertices in\n$\\X_0$, say across an edge labelled $s$, there is a standard 2--flat\ncontaining both, since the vertex $s\\in\\Gamma$ is in the support of a\nsquare of $\\Gamma$.\nThus, adjacent vertices in $\\X_0\\subset\\X_2$ have intersecting\n$\\bar\\phi$--images.\nIt follows that $\\bar\\phi$ is $(\\diam\\bar\\phi(1),\\diam\\bar\\phi(1))$--coarsely Lipschitz.\nClearly, $\\bar\\phi\\circ\\phi=Id_{\\X_3}$.\nThe map $\\phi\\circ\\bar\\phi$ agrees with $Id_{\\X_2}$ on $\\X_2\\setminus\\X_0$ and\nsends $x\\in\\X_0$ to the set of its cone vertex neighbors,\nwhich are all adjacent to $x$.\nApply \\fullref{inversecoarselipimpliesqi}."

      ],
      "proof": "Clearly\n  \\eqref{item:no_odd_modules}$\\implies$\\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_one}$\\implies$\\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair},\n  but the conditions provide case distinctions.\n  \n  If $\\Gamma$ is complete then it is either empty, a single vertex, or\n  a single edge, and it is reduced to the empty graph by\n  $|\\Gamma|$--many link doublings. The empty graph is the double of\n  itself, so the proposition is true in this case. Now assume $\\Gamma$\n  is incomplete so that we can apply \\fullref{doublingmodules}. \n\n In case~\\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair}, pick $v\\in\n A$ and consider $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$.\n From \\fullref{doublingmodules} we see that the only possible odd\n modules of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ come from odd modules of\n $\\Gamma$ that are not $A$ or one of its satellites in\n $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$.\nBy \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} the only possible\nchoices are $B$ or a satellite of $B$.  \nSince $B$ is adjacent to $A$ in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$ there is a unique module $B\\times\\{0\\}=B\\times\\{1\\}$ in\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ corresponding to $B$.\nIf $C$ is a satellite of $B$ in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$ then for every $c\\in\nC$ and every $b\\in B$ we have $\\lk(c)\\subset\\lk(b)$, so for every\n$\\ell\\in\\lk(c)$ there are edges $c\\edge\\ell\\edge b$ in $\\Gamma$.\nIf $\\ell=v$ then it does not appear in $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$.\nOtherwise, $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ contains edges:\n\\[(c,0)\\edge (\\ell,0)\\edge(b,0)=(b,1)\\edge(\\ell,1)\\edge(c,1)\\]\nThus any module of  $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ corresponding to a\nsatellite of $B$ in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$\nis a satellite of $B\\times\\{0\\}$ in $\\Gemini(\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma))$.\nIn particular,  every odd module of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ is\neither $B\\times\\{0\\}$ or a satellite of $B\\times\\{0\\}$, so\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ belongs to case~\\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_one}.\n\n In case~\\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_one}, pick $v\\in A$, and consider $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$.\n Again, by \\fullref{doublingmodules} the possible odd\n modules of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ come from odd modules of\n $\\Gamma$ that are not $A$ or one of its satellites in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$.\nBut \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_one} says there are none of these, so $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$\nbelongs to case~\\eqref{item:no_odd_modules} \n  \nIn case~\\eqref{item:no_odd_modules}  there are no odd modules, so $\\Gamma$ is a double by\n  \\fullref{characterizedouble}.\n\n\\medskip\n\nIn the other direction we show that if there exists $v\\in\\Gamma$ such\nthat \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} is true for\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ then\n\\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair}  was already true\nin $\\Gamma$.\nThus, by induction on the link doubling sequence, if \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair}  is false in\n$\\Gamma$ then it remains false in any iterated link double of\n$\\Gamma$.\nTherefore, every iterated link double of $\\Gamma$ contains odd twin\nmodules, so is not a graph double, so $\\Gamma$ is not a near double.\n\n\nSuppose there is $v\\in\\Gamma$ such that \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} is true for\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$.\nLet $\\sigma\\from \\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)\\to \\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$\nbe the involution that fixes the first coordinate and exchanges 0 and\n1 in the second coordinate. \nLet $\\pi\\from \\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)\\to\\Gamma$ be projection to the first\ncoordinate.\nBy construction of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$,  the map $\\pi$ sends edges to\nedges.\nIt follows that $\\pi$ sends twin modules to twin modules, so it induces $\\pi\\from\n\\Gemini(\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma))\\to\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$ that sends\nvertices to vertices and edges\nto edges.\n\nFurthermore, $\\pi$ preserves the satellite relationship, as follows.\nSuppose $B$ is a satellite of $A$ in\n$\\Gemini(\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma))$.\nThen $\\lk(B)\\subset\\lk(A)$, so $\\pi(\\lk(B)))\\subset\\pi(\\lk(A))\\subset\\lk(\\pi(A))$.\nHowever, it is possible that $\\pi(\\lk(B))\\subsetneq\n\\lk(\\pi(B))$, which happens when $\\{v\\}=M_\\Gamma(v)\\in\\lk(\\pi(B))$, so that\n$\\pi^{-1}(M_\\Gamma(v))=\\emptyset$.\nTo show $\\pi(B)$ is a satellite\nof $\\pi(A)$ we must rule out the possibility that \n $\\{v\\}=M_\\Gamma(v)\\in\\lk(\\pi(B))\\setminus\\lk(\\pi(A))$.\n Suppose this is the case.\n Clearly $\\pi(A)\\notin\\st(M_\\Gamma(v))$. \nWe cannot have $\\pi(A)$ as a satellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$, because that\nwould mean that\n$\\lk(\\pi(B))\\setminus\\{v\\}\\subset\\lk(\\pi(A))\\subset\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$,\nbut then triangle-freeness implies $\\lk(\\pi(B))=\\{v\\}$, which would\nmake $v$ a cut vertex of $\\Gamma$, which is a contradiction.\nBy \\fullref{doublingmodules}, the remaining option is that $A$ and\n$\\sigma(A)$ are distinct.\nThe condition $\\pi(B)\\in\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$ implies $\\sigma$ fixes the vertices in $B$.\nFor any $C\\in\\lk(B)\\subset\\lk(A)$ we have $\\pi(C)\\notin\\st(M_\\Gamma(v))$ by\ntriangle-freeness, so for all $a\\in A$, $b\\in B$, and $c\\in C$ there\nare segments $a\\edge c\\edge b$ and $\\sigma(b)\\edge\\sigma(c)\\edge\\sigma(a)$,\nwith $b = \\sigma(b) $, $\\sigma(c)\\neq c$, and $\\sigma(a)\\neq a$.\nBy construction of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$, if $a\\neq\\sigma(a)$ and\n$c\\neq\\sigma(c)$ and there exist edges\n$a\\edge c$ and $\\sigma(a)\\edge\\sigma(c)$ then there do not exist edges\n$a\\edge\\sigma(c)$ and $c\\edge\\sigma(a)$.\nThis contradicts $\\sigma(c)\\in\\lk(b)\\subset\\lk(a)$.\nThus, $\\pi(B)$ is a satellite of $\\pi(A)$. \n\n\\smallskip\n\nNow we argue that \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} for\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ implies \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair}  for $\\Gamma$. \nSince \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} is true for\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$, there are modules $A$ and $B$ of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$ that are\nneighbors in $\\Gemini(\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma))$, and such that every\nodd module of $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$  is either $A$ or $B$ or a\nsatellite of $A$ or $B$ in $\\Gemini(\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma))$.\nSince $\\pi\\from\n\\Gemini(\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma))\\to\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$ preserves\nsatellites, the potential odd modules of $\\Gamma$\nare, according to \\fullref{doublingmodules}, either $M_\\Gamma(v)$ or\none of its satellites, or the projection of an odd module of\n$\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$, which by hypothesis must be \n$\\pi(A)$ or $\\pi(B)$ or a satellite of one of these two.  \n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are adjacent, so are $\\pi(A)$ and $\\pi(B)$.\nBy triangle-freeness, they cannot both be in $\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$.\nSuppose $\\pi(B)$ is not in $\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$.\nThe alternatives are $\\pi(B)=M_\\Gamma(v)$, $\\pi(B)$ is a satellite of\n$M_\\Gamma(v)$, or $\\pi(B)$ is neither in $\\st(M_\\Gamma(v))$ nor a\nsatellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf $\\pi(B)=M_\\Gamma(v)$ or $\\pi(B)$ is a satellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$\nthen since $A$ and $B$ are adjacent, $\\pi(A)\\in\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$. \nIf $C$ is a satellite of $B$ then $\\lk(\\pi(C))\\subset\\lk(\\pi(B))\\subset\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$, \nso $\\pi(C)$ is a satellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$, so every odd module\nof $\\Gamma$ is either $M_\\Gamma(v)$ or $\\pi(A)$ or a satellite of one of\nthese. Since $\\pi(A)\\in\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$, vertices $\\pi(A)$ and $M_\\Gamma(v)$ are adjacent in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$ so \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} is true for\n$\\Gamma$.\n\n\n\nSuppose $\\pi(B)$ is neither in $\\st(M_\\Gamma(v))$ nor a satellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$.\nThen $\\pi(B)\\times\\{0\\}\\neq\\pi(B)\\times\\{1\\}$ are distinct and\nsymmetric, so we may assume\n$B=\\pi(B)\\times\\{0\\}$. We will show that $B$ and its satellites are even. \nSuppose $C$ is an odd satellite of $B$. \nSince $C$ is odd,  $\\pi(C)$ is not $M_\\Gamma(v)$ or a satellite of\n$M_\\Gamma(v)$, by~\\fullref{doublingmodules}.\nSince $C$ is a satellite of $B$ and $\\pi$ preserves satellites,\n$M_\\Gamma(v)\\notin\\lk(\\pi(B))\\supset \\lk(\\pi(C))$, so  \n$\\pi(C)\\times\\{0\\}\\neq\\pi(C)\\times\\{1\\}$ are distinct odd modules.\nTriangle-freeness implies that $\\pi(B)\\times\\{0\\}$, $\\pi(B)\\times\\{1\\}$, and\nsatellites of either of these two are distinct from $A$ and satellites\nof $A$. \nSo, by property \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} for  $\\double_v^\\circ(\\Gamma)$, both of $\\pi(C)\\times\\{0\\}$ and $\\pi(C)\\times\\{1\\}$ are satellites\nof $B$. \nHowever, for $\\pi(C)\\times\\{1\\}$ to be a satellite of\n$B=\\pi(B)\\times\\{0\\}$\nimplies $\\lk(\\pi(C)\\times\\{1\\})\\subset \\pi^{-1}(\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v)))$, so $\\pi(C)$ is a\nsatellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$ in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$, a contradiction, as we have already ruled this out. \nSimilarly, if $B$ is odd then $\\pi(B)\\times\\{1\\}$ is a satellite of\n$B=\\pi(B)\\times\\{0\\}$, so the same argument implies $\\pi(B)$ is a\nsatellite of $M_\\Gamma(v)$ in $\\Gemini(\\Gamma)$, which contradicts\nthat $B$ is odd.\nThus, $B$ and its satellites are even.\n\nThe same arguments apply after swapping the roles of $A$ and $B$.\n\nIn conclusion, if one of $\\pi(A)$ or $\\pi(B)$ is equal to or a satellite of  $M_\\Gamma(v)$ then \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} is true for\n$\\Gamma$ and we are done.\nOtherwise, since $\\pi(A)$ and $\\pi(B)$ cannot both be in $\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$, we may assume that $\\pi(B)$ is not, which implies that $B$ and its satellites are even. \nIf $\\pi(A)$ is also not in $\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$ then $A$ and its satellites are also even, leaving only $M_\\Gamma(v)$ and its satellites as possible odd modules of $\\Gamma$, so \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_one} is true for $\\Gamma$.\nOn the other hand, if $\\pi(A)\\in\\lk(M_\\Gamma(v))$ then the potential odd modules of $\\Gamma$ are $M_\\Gamma(v)$, $\\pi(A)$, or a satellite of one of these adjacent vertices, so \\eqref{item:all_odd_modules_satellites_of_pair} is true for\n$\\Gamma$."

      "proof": "As in \\fullref{lem:coloredtree1}, choose a base vertex $w_0$ of $T_{m+n+3}$and\n    describe vertices according to colored paths. \n   \n    For phase~1 of the construction, consider every vertex $v$ with an\n    outgoing $c$--edge.\n    Add a new edge labelled $d$ at $v$, and call its opposite vertex $vd$.\n    For each $j$, delete the edge between $vc$ and $vcb_j$ and instead connect $vcb_j$ to\n    $vd$ by an edge labelled $b_j$. \n    The effect is to `unfold' all of the $c$--edges, leaving the\n    $a_i$--edges in place at the end of the $c$--edge and moving the\n    $b_j$--edges to the  end of the new $d$--edge.\nSee \\fullref{fig:colortree2phase1}. \n    Call the result $\\phi_1$.\n    It is a coarse map, in the sense that some vertices are sent to a\n    set of 2 vertices at uniformly bounded distance 2 from one another. \n   $\\phi_1$  is a $(3,2)$--quasiisometry.\n    It may be easier to visualize the inverse of the (coarse) map in\n    \\fullref{fig:colortree2phase1}: it\n    `folds' co-incident edges $v\\edge vc$ and $v\\edge vd$ together to\n    make a single edge $v\\edge vc$.\n    This is actually a map, but is not 1 to 1 on vertices. \n\n    The coarse map $\\phi_1$ has the additional property that\n    for any $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_m,c\\}$--component $C$ there is a unique\n    color preserving isomorphism $\\phi_1^C$ such that for all vertices\n    $v\\in C$ we have $\\phi_1^C(v)\\in\\phi_1(v)$.\n    The same is true for $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,c\\}$--components, except\n    that edges colored $c$ are sent to edges colored $d$.\n    This is to say that at the level of trees there is not a\n    canonically nice way to make choices of image points such that\n    $\\phi_1$ is an honest map instead of a coarse map, but at the\n    level of $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_m,c\\}$--component and\n    $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,c\\}$--component there is, and it is unique, so\n    we will not further belabor the point, and simply speak of\n    \\emph{the restriction of $\\phi_1$ to $C$} as a well defined map.\n    So in \\fullref{fig:colortree2phase1}, we would say that $\\phi_1$\n    sends the unique $a_0c$ (red-green) colored geodesic through the basepoint\n    on the left isomorphically to the unique $a_0c$  (red-green) colored geodesic through\n    the basepoint on the right, and sends the unique $bc$ (blue-green) colored\n    geodesic through the basepoint on the left isomorphically to the\n    unique $bd$ (blue-olive) colored geodesic through the base point\n    on the right. \n\n\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n      \\centering\n     \\includegraphics{Pictures/coloredtree2phase1a}\n\\qquad\\tikz[baseline=-40pt]\\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- ++ (1,0);\\qquad\n            \\includegraphics{Pictures/coloredtree2phase1b}\n      \\caption{Phase~1 coarse map $\\phi_1$, with  $a_0$ red, $b_0$ blue, $c$ green, $d$ olive}\n      \\label{fig:colortree2phase1}\n    \\end{figure}\n    \n    Vertices with an incoming $c$--edge have outgoing\n    $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_m\\}$--edges, but no incident\n    $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges.\n    Vertices with an incoming $d$--edge have outgoing  $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n\\}$--edges, but no incident\n    $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_m,c\\}$--edges.\n    All other vertices have one incident edge of each color. \n\n\n    \n    For phase~2 of the construction, define a map $\\phi_2$ inductively with\n    increasing distance to $w_0$, as follows. See also \\fullref{fig:colortree2phase2}.\n    Our map $\\phi_2$ will be injective on vertices, but rearrange the\n    placement of some edges.\n    \n    Suppose $v$ is a vertex of less than full valence (of valence\n    less than $m+n+4$) and its incoming edge  is colored $c$.\n    Then $v$ has no $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges.\n    The vertex $va_0db_0a_0$ had full\n    valence at the end of phase~1, since it has incoming edge\n    colored $a_0$.\n    We claim it still has full valence now, so we can take all of its\n    $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges and donate them to $v$.\n    We further claim that none of the other phase~2 moves affect an\n    edge on the geodesic between $v$ and $va_0db_0a_0$.\n    \n    Now suppose $v$ has less than full valence with incoming\n    $a_0$--edge.\n    This could happen if it had full\n    valence at the end of phase~1, but donated its  $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges to a\n    predecessor earlier in phase~2.\n  The vertex $vca_0b_0a_0$  has\n    full valence, because it did at the end of phase~1 and its last\n    four edges are not $a_0db_0a_0$, so it was not called upon to\n    donate to a vertex with incoming $c$--edge. \nTake its  $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges and donate them to $v$.\n    \n    The construction for $v$ with incoming $d$-- or $b_0$--edges is\n    similar, swapping the roles of $a_0$ and $b_0$ and those of $c$ and\n    $d$.\n\n\n    \\begin{figure}[h]\n      \\centering\n   \\includegraphics{Pictures/coloredtree2phase2}\n      \\caption{Choices of donors for phase~2 map.}\n      \\label{fig:colortree2phase2}\n    \\end{figure}\n\n    Now we confirm the claim that these four types of donations do not\n    interfere with one another.\n    Given a vertex $u$, let $\\delta(u)$\n    denote its donor, if any.\n    Suppose $v$ is a predecessor of $w$ and let $w'$ be the immediate\n    predecessor of $w$.\n    For the geodesic $[v,\\delta(v)]$ to end on\n    $[w,\\delta(w)]$, and thus potentially have the donation to $v$\n    interfere with the donation to $w$,  would require a terminal segment of\n    $[v,\\delta(v)]$ to coincide with an initial segment of $[w',\\delta(w)]$.\n    The four possible labels of\n    $[v,\\delta(v)]$  are: \\[a_0db_0a_0\\quad\n      ca_0b_0a_0\\quad b_0ca_0b_0 \\quad db_0a_0b_0\\]\n    The four\n    possible labels of $[w',\\delta(w)]$ are:\n    \\[ca_0db_0a_0\\quad\n      a_0ca_0b_0a_0\\quad db_0ca_0b_0\\quad b_0db_0a_0b_0\\]\n    The maximal overlap between a suffix of the former and a prefix of\n    the latter is a single letter, which means that\n    $[v,\\delta(v)]\\cap[w,\\delta(w)]$ is empty unless $w=\\delta(v)$.\nEven in this case we have arranged that the edges donated to $v$ by\n$w$ are not one of the first edges on $[w,\\delta(w)]$, since when $w$\ndonates $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges, $[w,\\delta(w)]$ starts with $c$,\nand when $w$\ndonates $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_n,d\\}$--edges, $[w,\\delta(w)]$ starts with $d$.\n  \n    The new edges added\n    connect vertices that were at distance at most 8 after phase~1, so\n    the map $\\phi_2$ of phase~2 is $8$--biLipschitz on vertices.\n\n    Consider a $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--component in the tree before phase~2,\n    and suppose $w$ is its closest vertex to $w_0$.\n   Suppose that during phase~2 a predecessor $v$ of $w$ took the\n   $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges from $w$.\n   By construction, all predecessors of $v$ are already full valence,\n   so no vertex of $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--component at $w$ other than\n   $w$ will be called upon to donate $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--edges. \n   Thus, for any nontrivial geodesic word $u$ in letters\n   $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$, $\\phi_2(wu)=vu$.\n   However, $\\phi_2(w)=w$.\n   So $\\phi_2$ restricted to the $\\{b_0,\\dots,b_n,d\\}$--component based at\n   $w$ is a color preserving isomorphism except at the vertex $w$,\n   since an isomorphism of this component would have sent $w$ to $v$. \n\n    Similarly, each $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_m,c\\}$--component is sent to\n    within bounded Hausdorff distance of an\n    $\\{a_0,\\dots,a_m,c\\}$--component, and the map restricts to a\n    color preserving isomorphism except possibly at the unique vertex closest to $w_0$."
