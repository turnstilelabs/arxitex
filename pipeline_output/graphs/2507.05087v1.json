Thus a finitely generated group $Q$ has a solvable power problem if there is an algorithm that, given two words $u,v$ in the generators, will decide whether or not $u$ lies in the subgroup of $Q$ generated by $v$. When one moves from consideration of the word problem to consideration of the power problem, the appropriate analogue of the Dehn function is the rel-cyclics Dehn function, which we introduce in Section \\ref{s:dehn}. \n\n---\n\n\\label{r:solve}\nWith the Bounded Noise Lemma in hand, it is clear that the word problem is solvable in $Q$ if and only\nif $\\delta_Q(n)$ is a recursive function: on the one hand,  knowing which $w=1$ in $Q$, one can naively\nsearch for equalities of the form (\\ref{w:equ}) until one is found,  giving a bound on \n${\\rm{Area}}(w)$ that can be sharpened to an exact value by checking the finitely many products with\nfewer factors that satisfy the Bounded Noise Lemma -- thus $\\delta_Q(n)$ can be computed; conversely, \ngiven a word of $w$ length $n$,  if $\\delta_Q(|n|)$ can be computed, then one can determine whether $w=1$ in $Q$\nby testing the validity of  (\\ref{w:equ}) for each product with $M\\le {\\rm{Area}}(w)$ that satisfies the Bounded Noise Lemma, and there are only finitely many such equalities that need to be tested.\n\nWe shall employ a similar argument to see that the recursiveness of the following function is equivalent to the\nsolvability of the power problem in $Q$.",
