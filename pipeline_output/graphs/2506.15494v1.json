Identifying $P(W)$ and $P(W')$ with a common finite group $W_0$, again by \\ref{lemma - every f.g. group el. equivalent to a crysp gp is crysp}, we have that $L, L'$ belong to the same genus \\mbox{as $\\mathbb{Z}[W_0]$-lattices.}\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tWe now show that, under the additional assumptions of the present theorem, $L$ and $L'$ are isomorphic as $\\mathbb{Z}[W_0]$-lattices. By assumption ($a$), the order $m_i\\vcentcolon=[T:N_i]$ is finite, for all $i<k$. Hence, there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that:\n\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\tm=\\prod_{1<k}m_i.\n\t\\end{equation*}\n\t\\noindent\n\tSince $L$ and $L'$ belong to the same genus as $\\Z[W_0]$-lattices, it follows from Fact\\cspace\\ref{plesken_fact} that there exists an injective $\\Z[W_0]$-module homomorphism $\\sigma: L' \\rightarrow L$ such that the index $[T: \\sigma (T')]$ is coprime to $m$. In particular, $\\sigma(L')$ is a submodule of $L$, i.e., $\\sigma(T')$ is stable under the action of the point group of $W$. Therefore, $\\sigma(T')$ is a normal subgroup of $W$. By assumption ($b$), this implies that there are some $\\ell\\in\\N$ and $j<k$ such that $\\sigma(T') = \\ell N_j$. We distinguish two cases.\n\t\\begin{itemize}\n\t\t\\item[\\underline{Case 1}:] If $N_j=T$, then $\\sigma(T')=\\ell T$ and $\\sigma:L'\\rightarrow \\ell L$ is an isomorphism of $\\Z[W_0]$-lattices. Observe that if $\\ell=0$ the thesis is immediate, as both $L$ and $L'$ are trivial. Otherwise, for $\\ell\\neq 0$, the function:\n\t\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\t\t\\tau_\\ell:L\\rightarrow \\ell L, \\quad x\\mapsto \\ell x,\n\t\t\\end{equation*}\n\t\t\\noindent\n\t\tis naturally an isomorphism of $\\Z[W_0]$-lattices, since $T$ is supposed to be torsion-free and the action of $W_0$ on $T$ is linear. Therefore, the composition $\\sigma^{-1}\\circ\\tau_\\ell$ witnesses that $L$ and $L'$ are isomorphic $\\Z[W_0]$-lattices. \n\t\t\n\t\t\\item[\\underline{Case 2}:] If $N_j\\neq L$, then $[T:N_j] = m_j>1$. However, since:\n\t\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\t\t[T:\\sigma(T')]=[T:\\ell N_j]=[T:N_j]\\cdot [N_j:\\ell N_j]=m_j\\ell^n,\n\t\t\\end{equation*}\n\t\t\\noindent\n\t\tthis leads to a contradiction, as $[T:\\sigma(T')]$ was supposed to be \\mbox{coprime to $m$.}\n\t\\end{itemize}"

Moreover, by Lemma\\cspace\\ref{lemma-there are only finitely many Z-equivalence classes}, there are only finitely many such $\\Z$-equivalence classes. Therefore, it suffices to show that any two distinct $\\prec$-maximal centerings $\\overline{C}$ and $\\overline{C}'$ of $L$ cannot be $\\Z$-equivalent. The case $L=\\{0\\}$ is trivial. If $L\\neq\\{0\\}$, suppose for contradiction that there exists an isomorphism of $\\Z[W_0]$-modules $\\sigma:\\overline{C}\\rightarrow\\overline{C}'$. Identifying $\\Q\\overline{C}$ and $\\Q\\overline{C}'$ with $\\Q L$ via the isomorphisms induced by the inclusions $\\overline{C},\\overline{C}'\\leq L$, this map linearly extends to a $\\Q[W_0]$-module endomorphism $\\bar{\\sigma}$ of $\\Q L$.\n \t\n \t\\smallskip\\noindent\n \tSince $\\Q L$ is absolutely irreducible, it follows from \\cite[Theorem\\cspace29.13, Ch.\\phantom{.}IV]{representation_theory_book} that $\\bar{\\sigma}$ is a scalar multiplication by some rational number. In particular, this means that there exist $\\alpha\\in\\Z$ and $\\beta\\in\\Z^\\times$ such that $\\beta\\sigma(x)=\\alpha x$ for all $x\\in \\overline{C}$.

Clearly, $C$ is a centering satisfying $C\\prec\\overline{C}'$, by definition. Since $C$ has maximal rank, we must have $\\alpha\\neq0$, as otherwise $L$ would be trivial. Therefore, the identity $C=\\alpha\\overline{C}$ witnesses that $C\\prec\\overline{C}$.

Then, by Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - every reflection in a Weyl group is induced by a root}, there exists some root $\\alpha\\in R$ such that $s=s_\\alpha$. Since $V$ is Euclidean, by Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - every involution induces a decomposition of V in ker(1-s)+ker(1+s)} the subspaces $\\mathrm{ker}(1-s)$ and $\\mathrm{ker}(1+s)$ of $V$ correspond to $H_\\alpha$ and $\\langle \\alpha\\rangle_\\R$, with $H_\\alpha=\\{x\\in V:(\\alpha,x)=0\\}$ denoting the hyperplane orthogonal to $\\alpha$. We show that $\\langle\\alpha\\rangle_\\R\\cap T'$ and $H_\\alpha\\cap T'$ have rank $1$ and $l-1$, respectively.\n\t\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tSince $R$ is reduced, Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - every root in a reduced root system is the image of a root of the basis through an element of the Weyl group} ensures that each $\\alpha$ as above is actually the image of an element $\\alpha'$ in some basis $B'$ of $R$ through a map $w\\in W_0(R)$. Any such $w$ is an orthogonal map, i.e., an automorphism of $V$ preserving inner products, and hence it maps $H_{\\alpha'}$ into $H_\\alpha$ and $\\langle\\alpha'\\rangle_\\R$ into $\\langle\\alpha\\rangle_\\R$. In particular, $w$ transforms the decomposition $V=H_{\\alpha'}\\oplus\\langle \\alpha'\\rangle_\\R$ into $V=H_{\\alpha}\\oplus\\langle \\alpha\\rangle_\\R$. Therefore, since $T'$ is stable under the action of $W_0(R)$, this means that $w$ restricts to an isomorphism between $H_{\\alpha'}\\cap T'$ and $H_{\\alpha}\\cap T'$, and an isomorphism between $\\langle \\alpha'\\rangle_\\R\\cap T'$ and $\\langle \\alpha\\rangle_\\R\\cap T'$, respectively.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tBy Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - the Weyl group acts simply transitively on the set of bases of a root system}, $W_0(R)$ acts simply transitively on the set of bases of $R$. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume that $\\alpha$ belongs to one of the bases $B$ of $R$ listed in Table\\cspace\\ref{table - root systems, bases and reflections} in terms of the canonical basis $\\{\\epsilon_i:1\\leq i\\leq l\\}$ of $V$. According to the root system and lattice types realizing $n(W_0(R),L')\\geq 3$, we distinguish the following cases.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\t\\underline{{\\bf Case 1}}. $R=B_l$ and $T'=Q(B_l)=CL_l$, with $l\\geq3$.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tIn this case, $T'$ is the $\\Z$-linear span of the basis $B=\\{\\alpha_i:1\\leq i\\leq l\\}$ of $R$ such that:\n\t\\begin{equation}\\label{eq.1 - case B_l lemma logical characterization of affine reflections}\\tag{$\\star_3$}\n\t\t\\alpha_i=\\epsilon_i-\\epsilon_{i+1},\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\alpha_l=\\epsilon_l,\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad i\\in[1,l-1].\n\t\\end{equation} \n\t\\noindent\n\tBy \\ref{fact - basis of a root system}, $B$ is also a basis of $V$, and each element of $T'$ has a unique expression as a $\\Z$-linear combination of the $\\alpha_i$'s. {Therefore, $\\langle \\alpha\\rangle_\\R\\cap T'$ is clearly a subgroup of $T'$ of} rank $1$, with free abelian basis $\\{\\alpha\\}$ (alternatively, one can use  {Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - every vector in Q(R) l.d. from an indivisible root alpha, is Z-proposrtional to alpha}). To establish} that $H_\\alpha\\cap T'$ has rank $l-1$, we use the explicit description of $CL_l$ from Table\\cspace\\ref{table all inequivalent lattices}, {together with the fact that $\\{\\epsilon_i:1\\leq i\\leq l\\}\\subseteq B_l\\subseteq T'$. By \\eqref{eq.1 - case B_l lemma logical characterization of affine reflections}, we discuss two cases.}\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\t\\underline{{\\bf Case 1.1}}. $\\alpha=\\alpha_i=\\epsilon_i-\\epsilon_{i+1}$, for some $i\\in[1,l-1]$.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tIn this case, the subset $\\{\\epsilon_j:j\\neq i,i+1\\}$ of the canonical basis clearly consists of $\\R$-linearly independent vectors lying in the intersection $H_\\alpha\\cap T'$. Since $H_\\alpha$ is an $(l-1)$-dimensional subspace, it suffices to complete this set to an $\\R$-basis of $H_\\alpha$ by adding a suitable $\\beta\\in H_\\alpha\\cap T'$ that is $\\R$-linear independent from all the $\\epsilon_j$'s such that $j\\neq i, i+1$. The root $\\beta\\vcentcolon=\\epsilon_i+\\epsilon_{i+1}\\in B_l$ satisfies these requirements: it lies in $H_\\alpha$, since it is orthogonal to $\\alpha=\\epsilon_i-\\epsilon_{i+1}$, and it is clearly $\\R$-linearly independent from $\\{\\epsilon_j:j\\neq i, i+1\\}$. Consequently, $\\{\\beta,\\epsilon_j:j\\neq i, i+1\\}$ is a free abelian basis of $H_\\alpha\\cap T'$ of size $l-1$.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\t\\underline{{\\bf Case 1.2}}. $\\alpha=\\alpha_l=\\epsilon_l$.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tThis case is trivial: $\\{\\epsilon_j:1\\leq j<l\\}$ is a basis of $H_\\alpha$ lying entirely in $T'$.

Hence, any such a $x$ is of the form:\n\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\t\tx=\\sum_{j\\neq l-2}a_j\\alpha_j+2a_{l}\\alpha_{l-2}= \\sum_{j\\neq l-2,l}a_j\\alpha_j+a_{l}(2\\alpha_{l-2}+\\alpha_l).\n\t\\end{equation*}\n\t\\noindent\n\tIt follows that $\\{\\alpha_j,2\\alpha_{l-2}+\\alpha_l:j\\neq l-2,l\\}$ is a generating set of $H_\\alpha\\cap T'$. By extending it with $\\alpha_{l-2}$, we obtain a generating set for $T'$ of cardinality $l$. Consequently, Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - free abelian groups of finite rank are Hopfian}(3) ensures that $\\{\\alpha_{l-2},\\alpha_j,2\\alpha_{l-2}+\\alpha_l:j\\neq l-2,l\\}$ is a free abelian basis of $T$, and hence all the vectors in $\\{\\alpha_j,2\\alpha_{l-2}+\\alpha_l:j\\neq l-2,l\\}$ are $\\Z$-linear independent. This proves that $H_\\alpha\\cap T'$ has rank $l-1$, as required.\n\t}\\fi\n\t\n\t\n\t\n    Analogous to the previous. This concludes the proof of $[1\\Rightarrow2]$.\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\\medskip \\noindent\n\tFor the implication $[2\\Rightarrow1]$, assume that $T'\\cap\\mathrm{ker}(1-s)$ and $T'\\cap\\mathrm{ker}(1+s)$ are free abelian groups of rank $l-1$ and $1$, respectively. Then, $\\mathrm{ker}(1+s)$ is a subspace of $V$ of dimension at least $1$. We show that $\\mathrm{ker}(1-s)$ has dimension at least $l-1$. By Remark\\cspace\\ref{remark - all lattices with n>2 is of type Q(R) or P(R)}, $T'$ is either the group $P(R)$ of weights, or the group $Q(R)$ of radical weights of $R$. In both cases, it follows from Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - Q(R) is always a Q-structure in V} and \\ref{fact - P(R) is a Q-structure on V} that $T'$ is a $\\Q$-structure on $V$.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tLet $\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_{l-1}\\}$ be a free abelian basis of $T'$. In particular, these elements are linearly independent over $\\Z$. We claim that they are also linearly independent over $\\R$. Assume otherwise. Then, by definition of $\\Q$-structure (cf. \\ref{prop. - characterization Q-structures}(2)), $x_1,\\ldots,x_{l-1}$ must be linearly dependent over $\\Q$. That is, there exist $a_1,\\ldots,a_{l-1}\\in\\Z$, not all zero, and $b_1,\\ldots,b_{l-1}\\in\\N^+$ such that:\n    \\begin{equation}\\label{eq.1 - direction 2->1 lemma characterization of reflections}\\tag{$\\star_{8}$}\n        \\frac{a_1}{b_1}x_1+\\frac{a_2}{b_2}x_2+\\ldots+\\frac{a_{l-1}}{b_{l-1}}x_{l-1}=0.\n    \\end{equation}\n\t\\noindent\n    Let $c\\in\\N^+$ be the least common multiple of $b_1,\\ldots,b_{l-1}$. Since each $c\\cdot\\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\in\\Z$, \\eqref{eq.1 - direction 2->1 lemma characterization of reflections} yields the trivial $\\Z$-linear combination:\n\t\\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n        0&=c\\left(\\frac{a_1}{b_1}x_1+\\frac{a_2}{b_2}x_2+\\ldots+\\frac{a_{l-1}}{b_{l-1}}x_{l-1}\\right)\\\\\n        &=a_1\\frac{c}{b_1}x_1+a_2\\frac{c}{b_2}x_2+\\ldots+a_{l-1}\\frac{c}{b_{l-1}}x_{l-1}.\n    \\end{split}\n\t\\end{equation*}\n    By hypothesis, $x_1,\\ldots,x_{l-1}$ are linearly independent over $\\Z$. Therefore, the above identity implies that $a_i\\frac{c}{b_i}=0$, for all $i\\in[1,l-1]$. Since each $\\frac{c}{b_i}\\neq0$, this means that $a_1=\\ldots=a_{l-1}=0$, contradicting the assumption that the $a_i$'s are not all zero. This proves that $x_1,\\ldots,x_{l-1}$ are linearly independent over $\\R$.\n    \n    \\smallskip\\noindent\n    Consequently, $\\mathrm{ker}(1-s)$ and $\\mathrm{ker}(1+s)$ are real vector spaces of dimension at least $l-1$ and $1$, respectively. By Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - every involution induces a decomposition of V in ker(1-s)+ker(1+s)}, $s$ induces a decomposition of $V$ as a direct sum $V=\\mathrm{ker}(1-s)\\oplus\\mathrm{ker}(1+s)$.\n\tTherefore, $\\mathrm{ker}(1-s)$ must have dimension exactly $l-1$, and, by Definition\\cspace\\ref{def - reflection}, this confirms that $s$ is an affine reflection in $V$.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tFinally, the equivalence $[2\\Leftrightarrow3]$ follows directly from the fact that the conjugation $(\\,\\cdot\\,)^u$ on $T$ corresponds exactly to the action of $s$ on $T'$ via the natural $\\Z[W_0(R)]$-lattice isomorphism between $L=\\{(x,1):x\\in L'\\}$ and $L'$. More precisely, for each $x\\in T'$, we have:\n\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\t\\begin{split}\n\t\t\t(x,1)^u=(t,s)(x,1)(t,s)^{-1}=(t+s(x)-s(s^{-1}(t)),1)=(s(x),1).\n\t\t\\end{split}\n\t\\end{equation*}\n\tThis completes the proof."

      "proof": "In light of Fact\\cspace\\ref{Oger}, it suffices to show that every crystallographic group $W$ arising from an irreducible root system is first-order rigid. \n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tBy Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - existence reduced root system and sandwich condition}, $W$ admits an affine realization as a group of isometries of a real Euclidean vector space $V$, with point group the Weyl group $W_0(R)$ of an irreducible root system $R$ in $V$, and translation lattice of the form $L=\\{(t,1):t\\in L'\\}$, where $L'$ is a lattice in $V$ satisfying:\n\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\tQ(R)\\leq L'\\leq P(R).\n\t\\end{equation*}\n\t\\noindent\n\tBy Lemma\\cspace\\ref{lemma-every_lattice_L_s.t._Q(R)<L<P(R)_is_absolutely_irreducible}, $L'$ and $L$ are absolutely irreducible. Therefore, if $H$ is a finitely generated group elementarily equivalent to $W$, it follows from Lemma\\cspace\\ref{thm. - absolutely irreducible -> there are only finitely many maximal centerings} and Theorem\\cspace\\ref{theorem} that $H$ is crystallographic with point group $P(H)\\cong W_0(R)$ and translation lattice $L(H)\\cong L$. In other words, both $W$ and $H$ are extensions of $W_0(R)$ by $L$. According to the number $n(W_0(R),L)$ of isomorphism classes of such extensions, we distinguish the following cases.\t\n\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\t\\underline{{\\bf Case 1}}. $n(W_0(R),L)=1$.\n\t\\newline In this case both $W$ and $H$ are split and the result follows immediately.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\t\\underline{{\\bf Case 2}}. $n(W_0(R),L)=2$.\n\t\\newline In this case there are just two non-isomorphic extensions of $W_0(R)$ by $L$: one split and the other non-split. By Lemma\\cspace\\ref{lemma-split extensions are definable}, there is a sentence $\\psi_R$ (depending only on $R$) that is satisfied only by those extensions of $W_0(R)$ by $L$ that are split. So, since $W$ and $H$ are elementarily equivalent, either they both satisfy $\\psi_R$ (and they are split), or they satisfy $\\neg\\psi_R$ (and they are non-split). In both cases they are isomorphic.\n\t\n\t\\smallskip\\noindent\n\tFrom the standard classification of wallpaper groups (cf. \\cite[Table\\cspace2]{hiller}), it is known that for any Weyl group $W_0(R)$ associated to an irreducible root system $R$ of rank $2$ there are at most two isomorphism classes of $2$-dimensional crystallographic groups having $W_0(R)$ as point group. Hence, in the remaining cases we may assume that the rank $l$ of $R$ is at least $3$. In this setting, both $W$ and $H$ are isomorphic to certain representatives of Martinais's classification (see Table\\cspace\\ref{table - explicit crystallographic groups}). Consequently, for fixed $R$ and $L$, it suffices to prove that no two such representatives are elementarily equivalent. In particular, in each case we will distinguish the non-split extensions $W_n$ listed in Table\\cspace\\ref{table - explicit crystallographic groups} by means of sentences of the form:\n\t\\begin{equation}\\label{eq.0 - lemma - all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid}\\tag{$\\star_{10}$}\n\t\t\\zeta_m\\equiv \\forall x_1,\\ldots,x_l(\\eta_{\\Delta_S}(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)\\rightarrow \\chi_m(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)),\n\t\\end{equation}\n\t\\noindent\n\tsuch that:\n\t\\begin{enumerate}[$\\bullet$]\n\t\t\\item $W_n\\models\\zeta_m$ if and only if $n=m$;\n\t\t\\item $\\eta_{\\Delta_S}(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)$ is a formula as in Notation\\cspace\\ref{notation - lemma all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid}, depending only on the Coxeter system $(W_0(R),S)$ given by the simple reflections $S=\\{s_1,\\ldots,s_l\\}$ of Table\\cspace\\ref{table - root systems, bases and reflections}, and a fixed set of group words $w_g(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)$;\n\t\t\\item $\\chi_m(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)$ is a formula consisting of a quantifier free formula $\\tau_m(z_1,\\ldots,z_l)$ \n\t\t\n\t\tpreceded by quantifications bounded over the cosets $x_1T,\\ldots,x_lT$, that is, quantifications of type $\\forall z_i\\in x_iT$ and $\\exists z_i\\in x_iT$. In particular, the truth value of $\\chi_m(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)$ depends only on the cosets $x_1T,\\ldots,x_lT$, and not strictly on $x_1,\\ldots,x_l$ themselves.\n\t\t\n\t\\end{enumerate}\n\t\\noindent \n\tBy Remark\\cspace\\ref{notation_2 - lemma all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid}, if $(u'_1,\\ldots,u'_l)$ is a tuple realizing $\\eta_{\\Delta_S}(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)$ in $W_n$ and $u_1=(t_1,s_1),\\ldots,u_l=(t_l,s_l)$ are the generators in the presentation of $W_n$ in Table\\cspace\\ref{table - explicit crystallographic groups} corresponding to the simple reflections $s_1,\\ldots,s_l$, then there exist some $u\\in W_n$ and a graph automorphism $f_\\sigma$ of $(W_n/T,\\{u_1T,\\ldots,u_lT\\})$ such that, for every $i\\in[1,l\\,]$:\n\t\\begin{equation}\\label{eq.1 - lemma - all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid}\\tag{$\\star_{11}$}\n\t\tu'_iT=(f_\\sigma(u_iT))^{uT}.\n\t\\end{equation}\n\t\\noindent\n\tSince $f_\\sigma$ acts as a permutation of $\\{u_1T,\\ldots,u_lT\\}$, it can be identified with the corresponding index permutation $\\sigma$ such that $f_\\sigma(u_iT)=u_{\\sigma(i)}T$ for each $i\\in[1,l\\,]$. Consequently, \\eqref{eq.1 - lemma - all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid} reduces to the following coset identity:\n\t\\begin{equation}\\label{eq.2 - lemma - all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid}\\tag{$\\star_{12}$}\n\t\tu'_iT=(u_{\\sigma(i)}T)^{uT}=uu_{\\sigma(i)}u^{-1}T=(u_{\\sigma(i)})^uT.\n\t\\end{equation}\n\t\\noindent\n\tBy construction, the truth value of $\\chi_m(x_1,\\ldots,x_l)$ only depends on the cosets $x_1T,\\ldots,x_lT$ and not on $x_1,\\ldots,x_l$ themselves. Hence, \\eqref{eq.2 - lemma - all crystallographic groups arising from irreducible root systems are f.o. rigid and profinitely rigid} and the fact that  $(\\,\\cdot\\,)^u\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(W_n)$ witness that:\n\t\\begin{equation*}\n\t\t\\begin{split}\n\t\t\tW_n\\models\\chi_m(u_1',\\ldots,u_l') \\quad&\\iff\\quad W_n\\models\\chi_m((u_{\\sigma(1)})^u,\\ldots,(u_{\\sigma(l)})^u)\\\\\n\t\t\t&\\iff\\quad W_n\\models\\chi_m(u_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,u_{\\sigma(l)}).\n\t\t\\end{split}\n\t\\end{equation*}\n\t\\noindent\n\tIn all but one of the cases considered below, the root system $R$ is of type $B_l$ or $C_l$ (cf. Table\\cspace\\ref{table all inequivalent lattices}), and by Fact\\cspace\\ref{fact - form of inner-by-graph automorphisms in the case B_l,C_l,D_l} the permutation $\\sigma$ is trivial. In the remaining case, $R$ is of type $D_l$, and the only non-trivial graph automorphism corresponds to the transposition of the indices $l-1$ and $l$.

Hence, it has square:\n    \t\t\\begin{equation}\\label{eq.4 - case C_l main thm}\\tag{$\\star_{19}$}\n    \t\t\tz_l^2=\\left((2a^4_1+3)\\epsilon_1+\\sum_{i=2}^{l-1}(2a^4_i+1)\\epsilon_i,1\\right).\n    \t\t\\end{equation}\n    \t\t\\noindent\n    \t\tIf the identity $z_2^2=z_l^2$ were to hold, then comparing the terms of \\eqref{eq.3 - case C_l main thm} and \\eqref{eq.4 - case C_l main thm} with respect to the canonical basis would yield the following system of equations:\n    \t\t\\begin{equation*}\n    \t\t\t\\begin{cases}\n    \t\t\t\t&2a^2_1+2=2a^4_1+3\\\\\n    \t\t\t\t&a^2_2+a^2_3=2a^4_2+1\\\\\n    \t\t\t\t&a^2_2+a^2_3=a^4_3+1\\\\\n    \t\t\t\t&2a_i^2=2a^4_i+1\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad i\\neq1,2,3.\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t\\end{cases}\n    \t\t\\end{equation*}\n    \t\t\\noindent\n    \t\tHowever, this system is clearly inconsistent, since it contains the identity $2a_i^2=2a^4_i+1$ of an even and an odd number. It follows that no $z_2\\in(t^4_2,s_2)T$ and $z_l\\in(t^4_l,s_l)T$ have the same square, and hence that $W_4\\models\\chi_4((t^4_1,s_1),\\ldots,(t^4_l,s_l))$.\n    \t\t\n    \t\\end{claimproof}\n    \n    \t\\noindent\n    \tSince in each case we have found a first-order sentence separating the representatives from Martinais's classification, this concludes the proof."
