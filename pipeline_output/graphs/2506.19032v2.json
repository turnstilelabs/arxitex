The non-abelian finite simple groups with order coprime to 5 are recorded in \\cite[Table 1]{zavarnitsine2006recognition}, and reproduced here in \\Cref{tab:co5}.

This immediately implies $p\\notin \\{29,43,47,71\\}$.\nIf $r \\in \\pi(G)$ divides $q^j-1=p^{je}-1$, then by \\Cref{mult_order_lemma}, $je$ must be a multiple of the multiplicative order $i(p,r)$ of $p$ modulo $r$, and in particular have $p^{i(p,r)}-1$ as a divisor. We record each remaining possibility for $p,r$ along with $i(p,r)$ in \\Cref{tab:mult_order}. \nIn most cases, $\\pi(p^{i(p,r)}-1) \\not\\subseteq \\pi(G)$, so cannot arise. \n\nWe now consider each option for $K$ in turn.\nFirstly, $K \\neq {}^3D_4(q), \\mathrm{G}_2(q)$, since each has $q^6-1$ as a divisor, and hence has order divisible by $7\\notin \\pi(G)$.\nIf $K = {}^2\\mathrm{G}_2(q)$ with $q=3^{2k+1}$ and $k>0$, then, by \\Cref{tab:mult_order}, $q-1$ must only be divisible by 2, which is a contradiction by Lemma \\ref{2-3prime} since $q>3$.\nSuppose now that $K = \\mathrm{PSL}_3(q)$ or $\\mathrm{PSU}_3(q)$, and set $\\epsilon=1$ and $-1$ respectively. Then $|K|$ is divisible both by a primitive prime divisor of $q-1$, and a primitive prime divisor of $q^{3(1-\\epsilon)/2}-1$. Hence $p\\neq 2,3$. Noting that $(p^3-\\epsilon)\\mid (q^3-\\epsilon)$ allows us to eliminate $p= 173,283$ directly.\n\nFinally, suppose $K = L_2(q)$. Noting that $(p^2-1) \\mid (q^2-1)$ and that $|K|$ is divisible by at least three primes, we see that we must have either $K \\cong \\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)$, or $K\\cong \\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)$.\n\nSo each direct factor of the socle of $H$ is abelian, or isomorphic to one of $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)$ or $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)$.\n\nConsider $H/\\mathrm{Sol}(H)$, the quotient of $H$ by its solvable radical.\nNote that $\\{29,43,173\\}$ and $\\{47,71,283\\}$ form co-cliques in $\\Gamma(H) \\cong \\Gamma(G)$, so at most one prime from each set divides $|\\mathrm{Sol}(H)|$ by \\Cref{vas_indep_set}.\n By the Correspondence Theorem, $H/\\mathrm{Sol}(H)$ has no solvable subgroups, so every factor of the socle is non-abelian. In particular, \n$\\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)\\times \\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)\\leq \\mathrm{soc}(H/\\mathrm{Sol}(H))$, otherwise $\\mathrm{Sol}(H)$ violates \\Cref{vas_indep_set}.\n\nIndeed, $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)\\times \\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)=  \\mathrm{soc}(H/\\mathrm{Sol}(H))$, otherwise any further direct factor extends one of the simplices $\\{173,283\\}$ or $\\{2,3,29\\}$ into a larger simplex that does not lie in $\\Pi(G)$. \nNow $\\mathrm{soc}(H/\\mathrm{Sol}(H))\\cong \\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)\\times \\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)$ acts on the chief factors of $\\mathrm{Sol}(H)$, and we can consider this as a vector space action. Computing the modular character tables for $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)\\times \\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)$ directly in Magma, we see that elements of orders $2059 =29\\times 71$ and $2021=43\\times 47$ fix a non-trivial subspace in every characteristic $r \\in \\pi(G)$. Hence, if $\\mathrm{Sol}(H)$ is non-trivial, then $H$ has a simplex containing either $\\{29,71\\}$ or $\\{43,47\\}$ that does not lie in $\\Pi(G)$. Hence $\\mathrm{Sol}(H)$ is trivial.\nFinally, we check directly that no proper normaliser of $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(173)\\times \\mathrm{PSL}_2(283)$ has the same prime simplicial complex. Hence $H\\cong G$ and $G$ is recognisable by prime simplicial complex."

Now necessarily $k$ is the largest integer such that $n\\geq\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i.$ Also, for every prime at most $n$, there exist $k-1$ other primes such that their sum is at most $n$. This implies that $n\\geq p+\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} p_i$. Moreover, since $n < \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} p_i$, we have that $p_{k+1}+p_k>p$. \\par \nLet $P(n)$ be the statement: If $k$ is the largest integer such that $$n \\geq  \\sum_{i=1}^k p_i,$$ then $$n < \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} p_i + p.$$ Put $f(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} p_i + p.$ We will prove by induction that $P(n)$ holds for all $n\\geq 5,$ which is a contradiction to $p$ lying in a maximal simplex of size $k,$ and hence implies that the prime simplicial complex is not pure. \nFor the base case, we verify directly in GAP \\cite{GAP4} that $P(n)$ holds for $10\\leq n\\leq 129.$ \nNow suppose $P(n)$ is true, consider $P(n+1).$ If $n+1$ is prime, then $P(n+1)$ is obviously true, so we can assume that $n+1$ is not prime. Now we have three cases to consider. \\par \n\\underline{Case 1: $k$ and $p$ are the same for $n$ and $n+1.$}  Here we have that $f(n)=f(n+1).$ We want to show that $n+1 < f(n).$  \nSince $n\\geq 129,$ we have that $p_{k-1}\\geq 25,$ so by \\Cref{primes} we have that $\\frac{5}{6}(n+1)<p<n+1$ and also that $p< p_k+p_{k+1}< \\frac{66}{25}p_{k-1}.$ Putting these together gives that $\\frac{125}{396}(n+1) < p_{k-1},$ so $$f(n)= \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} p_i + p > \\frac{125}{396}(n+1) + \\frac{5}{6}(n+1) > n+1, $$ as required. \\par \n\\underline{Case 2: $n+1 \\geq  \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} p_i>n.$} This implies that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} p_i=n+1.$ \\Cref{sumprimes} implies that $p_{k+1}<p,$ so $n+1 < \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i +p$ and $P(n+1)$ holds.\\par \n\\underline{Case 3: The largest prime $p'$ such that $p'< n+1$ is not $p.$} In this case we necessarily have $p'=n.$ Since $n\\geq 25,$ we have that $f(n+1)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i +p'>n+1,$ so $P(n+1)$ holds."

Note that for the division by $4$ it is necessary that $q$ is odd, hence for $k\\geq 1$ the order of this torus will still be divisible by $2.$ The smallest groups containing such a torus have rank at least $\\frac{k^2+3k-4}{2},$ so the result follows.\n\nNow consider the case when $G\\cong \\mathrm{PSL}_n(q).$ If $G$ contains a torus whose order is $$\\frac{1}{(n,q-1)(q-1)} (q-1)(q^2-1)(q^3-1)(q^4-1)\\dots (q^{k+1}-1).$$ As shown before, $(q^3-1)(q^4-1)\\dots (q^{k+1}-1)$ has at least $k+1$ distinct prime divisors, so $G$ is not pure of maximal simplex size $k.$ Hence $$\\mathrm{rank}(G)\\geq\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}-1,$$ as required. \n\nNow consider the case when $G=\\mathrm{PSU}_n(q).$ If $G$ contains a torus whose order is $$\\frac{1}{(n,q+1)(q+1)} (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)\\dots (q^{k+1}-(-1)^{k+1}),$$ then this torus has at least $k+1$ distinct prime divisors, as the primitive prime divisor of $(q^{2i}-1),$ which exists by \\Cref{zsigmondy} divides $(q^i+1)$ and not any $(q^j+1)$ for $j\\leq i-1,$ and each $(q^{2l}-1)$ also provides a new prime divisor, which is its primitive prime divisor for $l$ even and the primitive prime divisor of $(q^l-1)$ for $l$ odd. Hence if $G$ has a torus with this order we get that $$\\mathrm{rank}(G)\\geq\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}-1,$$ as required. \n\nFinally consider the exceptional groups. For $k=3,$ the bound trivially holds.\nFor $k=2,$ we see that for ${}^\\epsilon \\mathrm{E}_6(q)$ and $\\mathrm{F}_4(q)$ there is a torus whose order is $q^4-1,$ so by \\Cref{q4lemma} these have a simplex of size at least $3,$ for $\\mathrm{E}_7(q)$ there is a torus with order $(q^4-1)(q^3-1)$ and for $\\mathrm{E}_8(q)$ there is a torus of order $(q^4-1)(q^3-1)(q-1)$ by \\cite[Lemma 1.3]{MR2213302},  so these also give rise to a simplex of size at least $3.$ The result follows. \n\nNow assume that $q\\in \\{2,3\\}.$ The bound for exceptional groups holds trivially. For the classical groups we use similar methods to the case where $q\\geq 4,$ but here we cannot assume that $q^4-1$ has $3$ distinct prime divisors, so we need to consider larger tori.  \nIf $G$ is of type $\\rm{P\\Omega}_{2n+1}(q)$, $\\rm{PSp}_{2n}(q)$ or $\\rm{P\\Omega}^\\pm_{2n}(q),$ then consider groups $G$ that contain a torus whose order is $$\\frac{1}{4} (q^3-1)(q^4-1)\\dots (q^{k+4}-1),$$ for $q$ odd or $$ (q^3-1)(q^4-1)\\dots (q^{k+4}-1),$$ for $q$ even. For $q=3$ all $q^i-1$ in the order of the torus provide a new prime divisor, and for $q=2$ the only $q^i-1$ in the order of the torus that does not provide a new prime divisor is $2^6-1,$ but $q^4-1=5.3,$ so this torus will in both cases give rise to a simplex of size at least $k+1,$ so the result holds. Similarly for $G\\cong\\rm{PSL}_n(q),$ or $\\mathrm{PSU}_n(q),$ having a torus of size  $$\\frac{1}{(n,q-(\\epsilon1))(q-(\\epsilon1))} (q-(\\epsilon1))(q^2-(\\epsilon1)^2)(q^3-(\\epsilon1)^3)(q^4-(\\epsilon1)^4)\\dots (q^{k+4}-(\\epsilon1)^{k+4}),$$ will give rise to a simplex of size $k+1,$ so the result holds."

      "proof": "First consider the case when $G$ is sporadic or alternating. Then, by \\Cref{sporpurity} and \\Cref{anpurity} we have $G\\cong A_{10}.$\nFrom now on assume that $G$ is a finite simple group of Lie type. \nWe begin by supposing $q\\geq 4$; the cases $q=2,3$ will be dealt with separately at the end.\n    The classical groups with rank at least $4,$ with the exception of $\\rm{PSL}_5(q)$ and $\\mathrm{PSU}_5(q),$ do not arise, as they contain a torus whose order is divisible by $\\frac{q^4-1}{(4,q-1)},$ hence by \\Cref{q4lemma} they have a simplex of size at least $3.$  \n   Now suppose $G$ is isomorphic to one of the following: $\\cong \\mathrm{G}_2(q),$  $\\rm{P\\Omega}_5(q),$ $\\rm{PSp}_4(q),$  $\\rm{P\\Omega}_7(q),$ $\\rm{PSp}_6(q),$ $\\rm{PSL}_4(q),$ $\\mathrm{PSU}_4(q),$ $\\rm{PSL}_5(q)$  or $\\mathrm{PSU}_5(q).$ All of these groups have a torus of size divisible by $\\frac{q^2-1}{4},$ so by \\Cref{q2_divisors} they contain a simplex of size $3$ unless $q=4,$ $5,$ $7,$ $8,$ $9$ or $17.$ In these cases we check by direct calculation that the result holds. \n    \n    \n    By Propositions \\ref{psl2_pure} and \\ref{2b2_pure}, no groups isomorphic to $\\rm{PSL}_2(q)$ or ${}^2\\mathrm{B}_2(q)$ arise, since each has a maximal simplex of size one.\n\n  \n\n    Now suppose that $G \\cong {}^3 D_4(q)$ or $\\mathrm{F}_4(q)$. Then $G$ has a torus $T$ of size $|T| = (q^3- 1)(q+ 1)$. If $q\\neq 8$, $|T|$ is divisible by the (distinct) primitive prime divisors of $q-1$, $q^2-1$ and $q^3-1$, hence has a simplex of size at least 3. If $q=8$, a direct calculation shows $|T|$ is divisible by three primes.\n\n    \n    Similarly, suppose that $G \\cong {}^2\\mathrm{F}_4(q)$ with $q=2^{2m+1}$ and $m\\geq 2.$ Now $G$ has a torus of order $(q^2-1)=(q-1)(q+1),$ which has at least $2$ distinct prime divisors by Lemma \\ref{zsigmondy}. If $(q^2-1)$ had exactly $2$ distinct prime divisors, then we can conclude that $q-1$ and $q+1$ are prime powers, hence they are primes unless $q=8.$ If $q=8,$ a direct calculation shows that $G$ is not pure of a maximal simplex size $2$. If $q-1$ and $q+1$ are both primes, then $q-1$ is a Mersenne prime and $q+1$ is a Fermat prime, so $2m+1=2,$ which is a contradiction, so $G$ is not pure of maximal simplex size $2.$ \n\nNow suppose $G \\cong\\rm{PSL}_3(q)$ with $q=p^e$ with $e\\geq 1$. Then $G$ has tori of orders $(q-1)^2/\\alpha$, $(q^2-1)/\\alpha$ and $(q^2+q+1)/\\alpha$, where $\\alpha = (3,q-1)$. We first consider the case where $q$ is even. In this case, $(q^2-1)=(q-1)(q+1)$ with $q-1$, $q+1$ coprime. \nIf $(q^2-1)/\\alpha$ has exactly two distinct prime divisors, then either $q=8$ (and not pure by direct computation), or $q+1$ must be a Fermat prime. In the latter case, $e=2^i$ by Lemma \\ref{2-3prime} and $(q^2-1)$ is divisible by the primitive prime divisors of $2^{2^j}-1$ for each $1\\leq j \\leq i+1$. In particular, if $i>2$, then $(q^2-1)$ is divisible by at least four distinct primes and the result follows. We check directly that $\\rm{PSL}_3(4)$ and $\\rm{PSL}_3(16)$ are pure with maximal simplex size 2.\n\n\n\nNow assume $q=p^e$ is odd. If $q$ is not prime, then $(q^2-1)$ is divisible by the primitive prime divisors of $p-1$, $p^2-1$, $p^e-1$, and $p^{2e}-1$. At least three of these are distinct unless $q=9$, in which case the group is pure with maximal simplices of size 2. So suppose that $q$ is prime. \n\n\nIf $\\alpha=1$, then by Proposition \\ref{q2_divisors}, $q\\in \\{5,17\\}$. A direct calculation shows that $\\Pi(\\rm{PSL}_3(5))$ and $\\Pi(\\rm{PSL}_3(17))$ have maximal simplices $\\{37\\}$ and $\\{307\\}$ respectively and hence are not pure. \n\n\nSo now suppose $\\alpha=3$, so $3\\mid q-1$. If $(q^2-1)/3$ has only two distinct prime divisors, then we must have $q-1 = 3.2^k$ and $q+1 = 2^l.r^m$ for some prime $r$ and $k,l,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. If $k \\equiv 1\\mod 3$, then $q$ is divisible by 7, hence $q=7$ as it is prime. But $\\Pi(\\rm{PSL}_3(7))$ has a maximal simplex $\\{19\\}$, hence is not pure.\n\nNow suppose $G \\cong \\mathrm{PSU}_3(q)$ with $q=p^e$ with $e\\geq 1$. Then $G$ has tori of orders $(q+1)^2/\\beta$, $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ and $(q^2-q+1)/\\beta$, where $\\beta = (3,q+1)$.  \n\nFirst assume that $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ and $q^2-1$ have the same set of prime divisors, so by \\Cref{q2_divisors}, $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ has at least $3$ distinct prime divisors unless $q\\in \\{4,5,7,8,9,17\\}.$ In the latter case we check by direct computation that $G$ is not pure.\n\n\n\n\nNow assume that $q$ is odd and that $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ and $q^2-1$ do not have the same set of prime divisors, so $\\beta=3$ and $q+1=3r$ such that $(3,r)=1.$ We may assume that $q+1=3.2^k,$ as otherwise $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ would have at least 3 distinct prime divisors. If $e\\geq 2,$ then $(q^2-1)/\\beta=\\frac{(p^e-1)(p^e+1)}{3}.$ Here $(p^e-1)(p^e+1)$ has at least $3$ distinct prime divisors, the primitive prime divisors of $p-1,$ $p^e-1$ and $p^{2e}-1.$ Now $p-1$ is either divisible by two distinct primes, in which case $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ has at least $3$ distinct prime divisors, so $G$ is not pure of maximal simplex size $2,$ or $p-1$ is a power of two. Hence $p$ is a Fermat prime, and $p-1=2^{2^x}$ for some $x\\geq 0.$ Now $p+1$ is divisible by $2$ and $3,$ and if it had any other prime divisors we would get a simplex of size at least $3,$ so we can assume that $p+1=3.2^l.$ However, since $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ and $\\frac{p+1}{2}$ are consecutive numbers, it follows that $l=1,$ so $p=5.$ Now if $p=5$ and $e$ is even, then $3$ divides $5^e-1,$ so we do not need to consider that case, as then $(3,q+1)=1$. If $e=2m+1$ for some $m,$ then $5^{2m+1}+1$ has a factor of $5+1=6,$ so $5^{4m+2}-1$ has a primitive prime divisor $r$ not equal to $2$ or $3.$ Also $5^{2m+1}-1$ has a primitive prime divisor $s$ not equal to $2,$ $3$ or $r,$ so $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ has at least $3$ distinct prime divisors and gives rise to a simplex of size $3$. Hence $q$ is prime.\n\n\nNow assume that $q=2^e$ and that $(q^2-1)/\\beta$ and $q^2-1$ do not have the same set of prime divisors, so $\\beta=3$ and $q+1=3r^k$ such that $(3,r)=1.$ If $e$ is even, then $2^e-1$ is divisible by $3,$ so $(3,q+1)=1,$ so we do not need to consider this case. If $e$ is odd, then $2^e-1$ is a prime power, hence a Mersenne prime, so $e$ is prime.  \n\nSuppose that $G \\cong {}^2\\mathrm{G}_2(q)$ with $q = 3^{2m+1}$ and $m \\geq 1$. Then by \\Cref{2g2pure}, $G$ is not pure.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, suppose that $q\\in \\{2,3\\}$. We check directly that the groups in the following list each contain an element of order a product of three primes:\n\\[\n\\{\\mathrm{PSL}_7(2),\\mathrm{PSL}_5(3), \\mathrm{PSU}_7(2), \\mathrm{PSU}_5(3),\\mathrm{\\rm{PSp}}_8(2), \\mathrm{\\rm{PSp}}_6(3),\\mathrm{P}\\Omega_8^-(3),\\mathrm{P}\\Omega^-_8(2)\\}.\n\\]\nEach classical group over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ or $\\mathbb{F}_3$ of larger rank contains a subgroup isomorphic to one of these groups, or a central extension of one. Hence, each also has an element of order a product of three primes, and so cannot arise. We compute directly that no classical groups of smaller ranks with $q=2,3$ are pure with a maximal simplex of size 2. If $G$ is instead isomorphic to an exceptional group, we either check directly that $G$ has a maximal simplex of size not equal to 2, or use \\cite{craven2023maximal} to show that $G$ has a maximal subgroup with an element of order a product of three distinct primes."
