      "proof": "We begin by proving the surjectivity of the homomorphism. The abelian group~$\\rmB(\\calR)$ is defined to be generated by the isomorphism classes of all finite racks. Therefore, it suffices to show that the class of any finite rack can be written as a linear combination of classes of connected finite racks. \nWe can see this by induction on the number of the elements of~$R$. The empty rack is not connected but represents the zero element in the group~$\\rmB(\\calR)$, so we need not worry about it. If a rack~$R$ has exactly one element, it is connected, and we are done. \nSuppose now that~$R$ has more than one element and that the statement is true for all racks with fewer elements than~$R$. If~$R$ is connected, we are immediately done. If not, we can decompose~$R$ into subracks~$S$ and~$T$ with fewer elements. By induction hypothesis, we can write both~$b(S)$ and~$b(T)$ as linear combinations of~$b$'s of connected racks. Therefore, so can~$b(R)=b(S)+b(T)$.\n\nTo prove injectivity, we construct a homomorphism\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:basis_inverse}\n\\rmB(\\calR)\\longrightarrow\\bbZ\\{\\Rcon\\}\n\\end{equation}\nwhose composition with~\\eqref{eq:basis} is the identity. It then follows that~\\eqref{eq:basis} is injective as well, and therefore an isomorphism with inverse~\\eqref{eq:basis_inverse}.\n\nTo construct the homomorphism~\\eqref{eq:basis_inverse}, we recall that this is the same as an additive invariant of racks with values in~$\\bbZ\\{\\Rcon\\}$. We will define this invariant as follows. Take any finite rack~$R$. It can be written as the disjoint union of its maximal connected subracks~(see~\\cite[Prop.~1.17]{Andruskiewitsch--Grana}). More formally, if~$\\Pi(R)$ is the set of maximal connected subracks of~$R$, then \n\\[\nR=\\bigcup_{C\\in\\Pi(R)}\\!\\!\\!C.\n\\] \nWe claim that\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:sum}\nR\\longmapsto\\sum_{C\\in\\Pi(R)}\\!\\!\\![C]\n\\end{equation}\nis an additive invariant of finite racks with values in the abelian group~$\\bbZ\\{\\Rcon\\}$. First, it is obvious that the sum in~\\eqref{eq:sum} only depends on the isomorphism class of~$R$. This shows invariance under isomorphisms. Second, whenever we have a decomposition of~$R$ into~$S$ and~$T$ as in Definition~\\ref{def:decomposition}, we have to show that\n\\[\n\\sum_{C\\in\\Pi(R)}\\!\\!\\![C]=\\sum_{C\\in\\Pi(S)}\\!\\!\\![C]+\\sum_{C\\in\\Pi(T)}\\!\\!\\![C].\n\\]\nThis property follows from Lemma~\\ref{lem:connected_images}: every~$C$ in~$\\Pi(R)$ either is contained in~$S$ or in~$T$, and therefore, the set~$\\Pi(R)$ is the disjoint union of~$\\Pi(S)$ and~$\\Pi(T)$. This shows additivity. Both properties establish that we have an additive invariant, and thus, a homomorphism~\\eqref{eq:basis_inverse} with~$b(R)\\mapsto\\sum_C[C]$.\n\nIt remains to be seen that the composition with~\\eqref{eq:basis} is the identity. But this is straightforward from the definitions. Let~$D$ be a finite rack that is connected, so that~\\hbox{$\\Pi(D)=\\{D\\}$}. Then, the composition is\n\\[\n[D]\\longmapsto b(D)\\longmapsto\\sum_{C\\in\\Pi(D)}\\!\\!\\![C]=\\sum_{C\\in\\{D\\}}\\!\\!\\![C]=[D],\n\\]\nwhich clearly is the identity."

To see this, note that a morphism~$C\\to R$ is either injective or has an image that has fewer elements than~$C$:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:split_off_inj}\n|\\Mor_\\calR(C,R)|=|\\Inj_\\calR(C,R)|+\\sum_{|D|<|C|}|\\Mor_\\calR^D(C,R)|,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere~$\\Mor_\\calR^D(C,R)$ is the set of morphisms~$C\\to R$ with image isomorphic to~$D$. \n\nWe can write every element of~$\\Mor_\\calR^D(C,R)$ as a composition~$C\\to D\\to R$ where the first morphism is surjective and the second morphism is injective, and the group~$\\Aut(D)$ acts freely and transitively on the representations~(identifications of~$D$ with the image). Therefore, we have a bijection\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Mor^D_as_twisted_product}\n\\Mor_\\calR^D(C,R)\\cong\\Inj_\\calR(D,R)\\times_{\\Aut(D)}\\Sur_\\calR(C,D),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere we have written~$\\Sur_\\calR(C,D)$ for the set of surjective morphisms~\\hbox{$f\\colon C\\to D$} and the index~$\\Aut(D)$ means that we identify a pair~$(hg,f)$ with the pair~$(h,gf)$ whenever~$g$ is an automorphism of~$D$ and~$h$ is an injection~$D\\to R$. Under the bijection, the class~$[hg,f]=[h,gf]$ on the right corresponds to the morphism~$hgf$ on the left. \n\nBy induction, we see that the numbers~$\\Inj_\\calR(D,R)$ for~$|D|<|C|$ are determined by the numbers~$|\\Mor_\\calR(D,R)|$, and we see from~\\eqref{eq:split_off_inj} and~\\eqref{eq:Mor^D_as_twisted_product} that, together with~$|\\Mor_\\calR(C,R)|$, these  determine the~$|\\Inj_\\calR(C,R)|$.\n\nWe now take an element in the kernel of~\\eqref{eq:marks} and write it in the form\n\\[\n\\sum_{[D]}\\lambda_Db(D),\n\\]\nwhere~$D$ ranges over the isomorphism classes of connected finite racks.

There is a partial order on the set of isomorphism classes of connected finite racks, given by~$[C]\\leqslant[D]$ if and only if~$\\Inj_\\calR(C,D)\\not=\\emptyset$. Assume that one of the coefficients was not zero. Then we could choose~$[C]$ maximal among those with~$\\lambda_C\\not=0$. As we have~$|\\Inj_\\calR(C,D)|=0$ for~$[C]\\not\\leqslant[D]$, this gives\n\\[\n0=\\sum_{[D]}\\lambda_D|\\Inj_\\calR(C,D)|\n=\\sum_{[C]\\leqslant[D]}\\lambda_D|\\Inj_\\calR(C,D)|.\n\\]\nBy the maximality of~$C$, this is\n\\[\n\\lambda_C|\\Inj_\\calR(C,C)|=\\lambda_C\\Aut(C)\\not=0,\n\\]\na contradiction.

As the isomorphism classes of connected racks form an integral basis for~$\\rmB(\\calR)$ by Theorem~\\ref{thm:basis}, there is a unique homomorphism~\\eqref{eq:profile} of abelian groups that extends the profile. It remains to be checked that this homomorphism~$\\lambda$ is compatible with the multiplicative structure.\n\nAs the rack structure on a cartesian product~$R=S\\times T$ is given component-wise, \n\\[\n(s,t)\\rhd(s',t')=(s\\rhd s',t\\rhd t')\n\\]\nwe see that the left multiplication~$\\ell_{(s,t)}=\\ell_s\\times\\ell_t$ is the product of the left multiplications. As this corresponds precisely to the product in the Burnside ring~$\\rmB(\\bbZ)$ of permutations, we have shown that the equality~\\hbox{$\\lambda(S\\times T)=\\lambda(S)\\cdot\\lambda(T)$} holds for connected racks.

To show that it is injective, we need to recover the isomorphism types of the cycle~$C$ and the quandle~$Q$ from the rack~$C\\times Q$.\n\nThe canonical automorphism~$\\sigma_{X\\times Y}$ of a product of racks is given by the cartesian product~\\hbox{$\\sigma_X\\times\\sigma_Y$} of the canonical automorphisms:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{X\\times Y}(x,y)=(x,y)\\rhd(x,y)=(x\\rhd x,y\\rhd y)=(\\sigma_X(x),\\sigma_Y(y)).\n\\]\nIf~$X=C$ is a transitive cycle, then~$\\sigma_C$ is just that transitive cycle. If~$Y=Q$ is a quandle, then~$\\sigma_Q=\\id_Q$ is the identity. Thus, we see that~$\\sigma_{C\\times Q}=\\sigma_C\\times\\id_Q$ decomposes into as many cycles of type~$C$ as~$Q$ has elements. This determines the cycle type~$C$. For the isomorphism type of the quandle~$Q$, we note that the argument above shows that the projection~$C\\times Q\\to Q$ induces an isomorphism between~$Q$ and the set of~$\\sigma_{C\\times Q}$--orbits of~$C\\times Q$. In other words, we can recover~$Q$ as the associated quandle of the rack~$C\\times Q$, which is the value of the left-adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of quandles to the category of racks."

The group~$G$ acts transitively on the set~$R$ of eight non-zero vectors in~$\\mathbb{F}_3^2$. The stabiliser~$H$ of the first standard basis vector is the subgroup of order~$3$ that consists of the upper-triangular matrices with~$1$'s on the diagonal. Thus, we can identify~$R$ with~$G/H$; a coset~$bH$ corresponds to the first column of the matrix~$b$. As in~\\eqref{eq:like-x-set}, a connected rack structure on this set is given by~$aH\\rhd bH=ama^{-1}bH$ with the following matrix~$m$, which commutes with all~$h\\in H$.\n\\[\nm=\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\ \\phantom{-}0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThen~$aH$ acts on the vector~$bH$ by left-multiplication with the matrix~$ama^{-1}$, which only depends on the coset~$aH$. Note that the actions of~$aH$ and~$-aH$ are equal, as~$ama^{-1}=(-a)m(-a)^{-1}$ so that the eight vectors only produce four different matrices. Since~$aH\\rhd aH=amH$, we see that the canonical automorphism is given by right-multiplication with~$m$, which is a non-trivial involution, since~$m\\not\\in H$ but~$m^2\\in H$. The quotient is the associated quandle, which is connected and has order~$4$, so it must be isomorphic to the tetrahedral quandle. However, the rack~$R$ is not isomorphic to the product of the tetrahedral quandle and the cyclic rack of order~$2$, as the inner automorphism group of~$R$ is isomorphic to~$\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_3)$. In contrast, the inner automorphism group of that product is the product~\\hbox{$\\mathrm{A}_4\\times\\mathrm{C}_2$}. We refer to~\\cite[Ex.~8.6]{HSV} for more information related to~$R$.",

We claim that this is given by sending~$\\delta\\colon X\\to G$ to the class~$b(X)$ of the rack~$X$ with~\\hbox{$x\\rhd y=\\delta(x)y$}. To see that this is an additive invariant, note that equivalent crossed actions give rise to isomorphic racks and that the rack corresponding to a sum~\\hbox{$(\\delta,\\epsilon)\\colon X\\sqcup Y\\to G\\times H$} is decomposed into~$X$ and~$Y$ so that it maps to the sum~$b(X)+b(Y)$ in~$\\rmB(\\calR)$. We note that this homomorphism is multiplicative.\n\nWe now define a morphism~$\\rmB(\\calR)\\to\\rmB(\\calX)$, i.e., an additive invariant of finite racks with values in~$\\rmB(\\calX)$. We claim that this is given by sending a finite rack~$(R,\\delta)$ to~$b(\\delta\\colon R\\to\\Aut(R))$. To see that this function is an additive invariant, note first that isomorphic racks give isomorphic crossed actions. Then, a decomposition of a rack~$R$ into a disjoint union of subracks~$S$ and~$T$ gives rise to equivalent crossed actions~$R\\to\\Aut(R)$ and~\\hbox{$S\\sqcup T\\to\\Aut(S)\\times\\Aut(T)$}. This time, the equivalence is given by the identity on underlying sets, and the inclusion\n\\[\n\\Aut(S)\\times\\Aut(T)\\leqslant\\Aut(S\\sqcup T)=\\Aut(R)\n\\]\nof groups.\n\nFinally, we need to check that the compositions are the identity. This is trivial for the composition~$\\rmB(\\calR)\\to\\rmB(\\calX)\\to\\rmB(\\calR)$, as this sends the class~$b(R,\\rhd)$ of a rack~$(R,\\rhd)$ to itself. The other composition sends a crossed action~\\hbox{$\\delta\\colon X\\to G$} to the crossed action~\\hbox{$\\delta\\colon X\\to \\Aut(X)$}, and the latter is equivalent to the former via the equivalence that is given by the identity on underlying sets, and the morphism~$G\\leqslant\\Aut(X)$ of groups given by the action."
