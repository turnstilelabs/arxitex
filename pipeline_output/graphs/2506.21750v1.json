      "proof": "Let $(\\Omega,X,X,\\mu)$ be a measure equivalence coupling from $G$ to $H$. As previously, we write $\\alpha \\colon G \\times X \\rightarrow H$ and $\\beta \\colon H \\times X \\rightarrow G$ for the measure equivalence cocycles.\n\t\n\tFirst we need the action of $G\\times H$ to be essentially free as well. In general this is not the case. Therefore we make the following construction.\n\tLet $\\mathcal{B} = \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace^{G \\times H}$ and equip it with the shift action $G \\times H \\curvearrowright \\mathcal{B}$. Considering each copy of $\\lbrace 0, 1\\rbrace$ with the equiprobability measure, we obtain a product measure $\\mu'$ on $\\mathcal{B}$ with respect to which the shift action is probability measure preserving and essentially free as the product group is infinite. Extending the action of $G$ and $H$ diagonally to $\\Omega \\times \\mathcal{B}$ we now obtain a new measure equivalence $(\\Omega \\times \\mathcal{B}, X \\times \\mathcal{B}, X \\times \\mathcal{B}, \\mu \\times \\mu')$ for $G$ and $H$ and where the action of $G\\times H$ is essentially free. Its measure equivalence cocycles are given by $\\alpha'' \\colon G \\times (X \\times \\mathcal{B}) \\rightarrow H$ where $\\alpha''(g,(x,z)) = \\alpha(g,x)$ and $\\beta'' \\colon H \\times (X \\times \\mathcal{B}) \\rightarrow G$ where $\\beta''(h,(x,z)) = \\beta(h,x)$ which are $\\varphi$-integrable and $\\psi$-integrable respectively. \n\t\n\tNow, the induced actions of $G$ and $H$ on $(X \\times \\mathcal{B}, \\mu_{X} \\times \\mu')$ are essentially free and probability measure preserving, where $\\mu_{X} = \\mu(X)^{-1}\\mu\\vert_{X}$.\n\tWe claim that these induced actions are orbit equivalent, and that their cocyles are given by the measure equivalence cocycles, which proves that $(X\\times \\mathcal{B},\\mu\\times \\mu')$ is a $(\\varphi,\\psi)$-integrable orbit equivalence coupling.\n\tFirst, we note that for all $g \\in G$, we have $g\\ast (x,z) \\in \\alpha(g,x)^{-1}\\ast X \\times \\mathcal{B}$ for a.e. $(x,z) \\in X \\times \\mathcal{B}$. Fixing $g \\in G$ and letting $h = \\alpha(g,x)$, we then have for the induced actions that $g \\cdot (x,z) = g\\ast \\alpha(g,x)\\ast (x,z)$ and $h \\cdot (x,z) = \\beta(\\alpha(g,x),x)\\ast \\alpha(g,x)\\ast (x,z)$ for a.e. $(x,z) \\in X \\times \\mathcal{B}$.\n\tNow, without loss of generality it suffices to show that $\\beta(\\alpha(g,x),x)=g$ for a.e.\\ $(x,z) \\in X \\times \\mathcal{B}$, as it proves that $G\\cdot x\\subseteq H\\cdot x$ and that its orbit equivalence cocycle $G\\times (X\\times \\mathcal{B})\\to H$ is the same as $\\alpha''$.\n\tThis is true since $\\alpha(g,x)\\ast (x,z) \\in \\beta(\\alpha(g,x),x)^{-1}\\ast X \\times \\mathcal{B}$ and $g\\ast (x,z) \\in \\alpha(g,x)^{-1}\\ast X_G \\times \\mathcal{B}$ for a.e. $(x,z) \\in X \\times \\mathcal{B}$ and $X\\times\\mathcal{B}$ is a measure fundamental domain. Moreover, for every $g \\in G$, we have $g \\cdot (x,z) = \\alpha''(g,(x,z)) \\cdot (x,z)$ for almost every $(x,z) \\in X \\times \\mathcal{B}$. This concludes the first implication.\n\t\\\\\n\t\n\tTowards proving the converse, let $(X,\\nu)$ be an orbit equivalence coupling from $G$ to $H$ that is $(\\varphi,\\psi)$-integrable. Now, take $\\Omega = X\\times G$ with $\\mu = \\nu\\times \\bar{\\mu}$, where $\\bar{\\mu}$ is the counting measure. Note that $X$ can be seen as the subset $X\\times \\{e_G\\}$ of $\\Omega$.\n\tNext, let $G\\times H$ act on $(\\Omega,\\mu)$ such that $(g,h)\\ast (x,g')= (h\\cdot x , gg'\\beta'(h,x)^{-1})$. Then $(\\Omega,X,X,\\mu)$ is a $(\\varphi,\\psi)$-integrable measure equivalence coupling.\n\tIndeed, $\\Omega$ is standard Borel, as it is the product of two standard Borel spaces. The space $X$ is a measure fundamental domain of $G$, since $G$ acts by left multiplication on the $G$-component in $\\Omega$. Towards proving that $X$ is also a fundamental domain for $H$, note that $h\\ast (x,e_G)\\in \\beta'(h,x)^{-1}\\ast X$ for every $h\\in H$ and $x\\in X$, note that $\\beta'(h,x)=e_G$ if and only if $h=e_H$ for almost every $x\\in X$ because the action of $H$ on $X$ is essentially free and note that $h\\mapsto \\beta'(h,x)$ is surjective for almost every $x\\in X$. Hence, $X$ is a fundamental domain for the $H$-action and $\\beta(h,(x,e_G))=\\beta'(h,x)$. Finally, note that $(g, \\alpha'(g,x))\\ast (x,e_G) \\in X$, since $\\beta'(\\alpha'(g,x),g\\cdot x)=g$ for every $g\\in G$ and almost every $x\\in X$. So, $\\alpha(g,(x,e_G))=\\alpha'(g,x)$.\n\tThus, $G$ and $H$ have commuting, measure preserving actions on $\\Omega$, both actions have $X$ as a fundamental domain with finite measure and the cocycles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are $\\varphi$-integrable and $\\psi$-integrable respectively.\n\tThis concludes the proof."

      "proof": "Recall that according to our notation, $\\Lamp_k=\\Z/k\\Z\\wr \\Z$. Let $\\pi:\\Lamp_k\\to \\Z$ be the projection to $\\Z$. Given $q\\geq 1$, the pre-image of $q\\Z$ by $\\pi$ is isomorphic to $(\\Z/k\\Z)^q\\wr \\Z$, which itself is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to $\\Lamp_{k^q}$. In particular, $\\Lamp_{k^q}$ and $\\Lamp_k$ are quasi-isometric. Hence in order to prove the theorem, it is harmless to assume that $k$ is arbitrarily large. For reasons that will appear later (which are not essential), we will assume from now on that $k\\geq \\lambda$. \n\n\nWe will use the fact that $\\SOL_A$ is a uniform lattice in the group $\\SOL_\\R=\\R^2\\rtimes \\R$ where $\\R$ acts by $t\\cdot (x,y)=(k^tx,k^{-t}y)$. \n\nThe proof of the theorem goes in three steps: first we construct a sequence of maps between F\\o lner sequences of $\\Lamp_k$ and  $\\SOL_\\R$ (by far the main step of the proof). Actually we will construct a unique map between the groups and consider its restriction to a F\\o lner sequence. Second,  we will perturb this map slightly (at bounded distance) to have it land in a copy of $\\SOL_A$ embedded as a lattice in $\\SOL_\\R$. \nAlong the way all the metric estimates will be in terms of the word metrics of the groups. Hence a last technical step will be required to translate them in terms of the intrinsic graph distances of the F\\o lner sets.\n\n\\\n\n\\noindent{\\bf First step: constructing a map from $\\Lamp_k$ to $\\SOL_\\R$.}\n\nWe start defining generating sets for the groups $\\Lamp_k$ and $\\SOL_\\R$. \nWe let $S^\\Lamp=S_1^\\Lamp\\cup S_2^\\Lamp$, where $S_1^\\Lamp$ consists of elements $(x,0)$, where $x$ is supported at $0$, and $S_2^\\Lamp=\\{(0,\\pm 1\\}$.\nSimilarly we let $S^{\\SOL}=S_1^{\\SOL}\\cup S_2^{\\SOL}$, where $S_1^{\\SOL}$ consists of elements $(x,0)$, where $\\|x\\|_\\infty\\leq 1$, and $S_2^{\\SOL}=\\{(0,t\\}$, with $|t|\\leq 1$. We shall denote by $|g|$ the word length of an element of either $\\Lamp_k$ or $\\SOL_\\R$.\nWe shall use repeatedly the following easy estimates, whose verifications are left to the reader.\n For $g=(x,j)\\in \\Lamp_k$, \n\\[\\max \\left\\{\\diam(\\supp x\\cup \\{0\\}),|j|\\right\\} \\leq |g|\\leq 2\\diam(\\supp x\\cup \\{0\\})+|j|.\\]\nand for $g=(x,j)\\in \\SOL_\\R,$\n \\[\\max \\left\\{\\log_k\\|x\\|_{\\infty},|j|\\right\\} \\leq |g|\\leq 2\\log_k(1+ \\|x\\|_{\\infty})+2|j|.\\]\n\n\nWe consider the following F\\o lner sequences of $\\Lamp_k$ and $\\SOL_\\R$: \n\\[F_n^\\Lamp=\\left\\{(x,m)\\mid \\supp x\\subset [-n,n], \\; 0\\leq m\\leq n\\right\\},\\] \nand \n\\[F_n^{\\SOL}=\\left\\{(x,m)\\in \\R_+^2\\times \\R\\mid \\|x\\|_\\infty \\leq k^{n+1}, \\; 0\\leq m\\leq n\\right\\}.\\] \nLet us check that these are indeed right F\\o lner sequences. For both, almost invariance under right multiplication by $S_2^\\Lamp$ (resp.\\ $S_2^{\\SOL}$) is true because it only changes the second coefficient. For $F_n^\\Lamp$, we observe that it is invariant under right multiplication by $S_1^\\Lamp$, so it is duly a F\\o lner sequence. Note that right multiplication by $S_1^{\\SOL}$ preserves each coset of $\\R^2$. Besides, for every $j\\in \\R$, we have \n\\[([0,k^{n+1}]^2\\times\\{j\\}) S_1^{\\SOL}\\subset [-k^j,k^{n+1}+k^j]^2\\times\\{j\\}. \\]\nThe Haar measure $\\lambda$ on  $\\SOL_\\R$ is simply the product of the Lebesgue measure on $\\R^3$.\nTherefore, we have \n\\[\\lambda(([0,k^{n+1}]^2\\times\\{j\\}) S_1^{\\SOL})\\leq (k^{n+1}+2k^j)^2,\\]\nso\n\\[\\lambda(F_n^{\\SOL}S_1^{\\SOL})\\leq \\int_{0}^n (k^{n+1}+2k^j)^2dj=nk^{2n+2}+4k^{n+1}\\int_{0}^nk^jdj+2\\int_{0}^nk^{2j}dj\\leq (n+6)k^{2n+2},\\]\nAnd since $\\lambda(F_n^{\\SOL})=nk^{2n+2}$, we deduce that \n\\[\\frac{\\lambda(F_n^{\\SOL}S_1^{\\SOL})}{\\lambda(F_n^{\\SOL})}\\leq \\frac{n+6}{n},\\]\nwhich tends to $1$ as $n\\to \\infty$. Hence $F_n^{\\SOL}$ is a F\\o lner sequence.\n\n\\\n\nWe now define a map $\\vv:\\Lamp_k\\to \\SOL_\\R$  as follows. For $x=(\\eps_i)\\in \\oplus_\\Z \\Z/k\\Z$, we set\n\\[\\vv(x,m)=\\left(\\sum \\eps_i k^i, \\sum \\eps_i k^{-i},m\\right).\\]\n\nBefore analyzing the properties of this map, let us pause, and work out  the following baby case as a warmup. Consider the function $f:\\oplus_n \\Z/k\\Z\\to \\R_+$ defined  for each $x=(\\eps_i)$ by $f(x)=\\sum \\eps_i k^i$. Suppose we equip the group  $\\oplus_n \\Z/k\\Z$ with the length $|x|=\\max (\\supp x)$, and  $\\R_+$ is equipped with the distance $d(x,y)=\\log (1+|x-y|)$. Note that this is similar to the restriction of $\\vv$ to $\\bigoplus_\\Z \\Z/k\\Z$.  It is easy to see that the map $f$ is injective, Lipschitz, and takes values in $\\N$. Besides, for all $n\\in \\N$, $f$ maps bijectively $K_n=\\{x\\mid \\supp x\\subset [0,n]\\}$ to $I_n=[0, k^{n+1}-1]\\cap \\N$. By contrast, this map is not coarsely expansive. This results from the fact that $\\R$ is Archimedean, which manifests itself through carries: assume we add $1$ to $x=\\sum \\eps_i k^i$, and then write the $k$-adic decomposition of the resulting number, we get $x+1=\\sum_i \\eps_i'$, where $\\eps_i'\\neq \\eps_i$ for all $i\\leq m$, where $m$ is the smallest integer such that $\\eps_i\\neq k-1$. Hence the pre-image of $x+1$ lies at distance $m$ from $x$, and $m$ can be arbitrarily large. However, large values of $m$ happen ``exponentially rarely''. Let us indeed evaluate the proportion of elements of $x\\in K_n$ such that $d(x,f^{-1}(f(x)+1))\\geq m$: since it imposes that the first $m-1$ coordinates of $x$ are equal to $k-1$, this proportion is at most $k^{-m+1}$. \n\nWe are now ready to study our map $\\vv$, for which a similar phenomenon occurs, although in a more complicated way, as shown by the following lemma.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:psi}\nThe map $\\vv$ is $2$-Lipschitz, and maps $F_n^\\Lamp$ to a $(1+\\log_k (1+2k))$-coarsely dense subset of $F_n^{\\SOL}$. \nIt satisfies the following (statistic expansivity) property: for all integers $q,m\\geq 1$,\nthe proportion of points $g\\in F_n^\\Lamp$ such that $\\diam\\vv^{-1}(B_{\\SOL}(\\vv_n(g),q))\\geq 2m+3q$ is at most $4k^{-m+1}$. Finally, For every $r$, the preimage of balls of radius $q$ has cardinality at most $(2q+1)k^{2q+1}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet us prove Lipschitz: for this it is enough to consider neighboring vertices: for those who differ by their $\\Z$-coordinate, the statement is obvious, so consider the case of two elements $g,g'\\in \\Lamp_k$ such that $g'=gs$ for some $s\\in S_1^{\\Lamp}$. We then have $g=(x,j)$ and $gs=(x',j)$ where $x=(\\eps_i)$ and $x'=(\\eps'_i)$ only differ in their $j$-coordinate. We have $\\vv(g)=(y,j)$, where $y=(\\sum_i \\eps_i k^i, \\sum_i \\eps_i k^{-i})$ and $\\vv(g')=(y',j)$ with $y'=(\\sum_i \\eps'_i k^i, \\sum_i \\eps'_i k^{-i})$. So\n\\[\\vv(g)^{-1}\\vv(g')=\\left(\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{i-j},\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{j-i},0\\right)=(\\eps'_j-\\eps_j,\\eps_j-\\eps'_j,0),\\] \nwhich has length at most $2$. Hence the map is $2$-Lipschitz.\n\nLet us prove that $\\vv$ maps $F_n^\\Lamp$ to a coarsely dense subset of $F_n^{\\SOL}$. The fact that $\\vv(F_n^\\Lamp)\\subset F_n^{\\SOL}$ is obvious, so we focus on the coarse density. We shall prove that every element $h=(a,b,j)\\in F_n^{\\SOL}$ lies at bounded distance from $\\vv(F_n^\\Lamp)$. Perturbating $h$ at distance at most one, we can assume that $j\\in \\Z$. Let $g=(x,j)\\in \\Lamp_k$, with $x=(\\eps_i)$.\nWe have $\\vv(g)=\\left(\\sum_i\\eps_ik^i,\\sum_i \\eps_ik^{-i}, j\\right)$. Hence,\n\\[\\vv(g)^{-1}h=\\left(\\left(k^{-j}a-\\sum_i \\eps_ik^{i-j}\\right), \\left(k^jb-\\sum_i \\eps_ik^{-i+j}\\right), 0\\right).\\] \nSince $h\\in  F_n^{\\SOL}$, we have $\\lfloor k^{-j}a\\rfloor\\leq k^{n-j+1}$ and $\\lfloor k^{j-1}b\\rfloor\\leq k^{n+j}$, so their  $k$-adic decompositions are respectively supported in $[0,n-j]$ and $[0,n+j-1]$. Now, choose $\\eps_i$ be such that $\\sum_{i\\geq j} \\eps_ik^{i-j}$ is the $k$-adic decomposition of $\\lfloor k^{-j}a\\rfloor$, and  $\\sum_{i< j} \\eps_ik^{-i+j-1}$ is the $k$-adic decomposition of $\\lfloor k^{j-1}b\\rfloor$. It follows that $\\eps_i$ is supported on $[-n,n]$, hence that $g\\in F_n^\\Lamp$. \nBesides, \\[\\left|k^{-j}a-\\sum_{i\\geq j} \\eps_ik^{i-j}\\right|=k^{-j}a-\\lfloor k^{-j}a\\rfloor\n\\leq 1\\] and  \\[\\left|k^jb-\\sum_{i<j} \\eps_ik^{-i+j}\\right|=k\\left|k^{j-1}b-\\sum_{i<j} \\eps_ik^{-i+j-1}\\right|=k(k^{j-1}b-\\lfloor k^{j-1}b\\rfloor)\\leq k.\\]\nWe therefore have $\\left|k^{-j}a-\\sum_{i} \\eps_ik^{i-j}\\right|\\leq 2$ and $\\left|k^jb-\\sum_{i} \\eps_ik^{-i+j}\\right|\\leq 2k$, and so we have duly constructed an element $g\\in F_n^\\Lamp$ such that $d(\\vv(g),h)\\leq \\log_k (1+2k)$. \n\n\nWe now turn our attention to the last two properties, which will be proved all at once. \nFor this we fix some $g\\in F_n^\\Lamp$.\nLet $g'\\in \\Lamp_k$ such that $d(\\vv(g'), \\vv(g))\\leq q.$ Note that if $g=(x,j)$ and $g'=(x',j')$, we have \\[g^{-1}g' = ((-j)\\cdot (x'-x), j'-j).\\]\nWrite $x=(\\eps_i)$ and $x'=(\\eps'_i)$. We have\n\\[\\vv(g)^{-1}\\vv(g')=\\left(\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{i-j},\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{j-i},j'-j\\right).\\]\nThe condition that $d(\\vv(g'), \\vv(g))\\leq q$ implies that $|j-j'|\\leq q$. So $d(g,g')\\geq 2m+3q$ implies that $2\\diam((\\supp(x'-x)-j)\\cup \\{0\\})+q\\geq 2m+3q$, hence  $\\diam((\\supp(x'-x)-j)\\cup \\{0\\})\\geq m+q$.\nWe let $\\ell_+,\\ell_-$ be respectively the maximal, minimal integer such that $\\eps_{\\ell_+}\\neq \\eps'_{\\ell_+}$,  $\\eps_{\\ell_-}\\neq \\eps'_{\\ell_-}$.\nNote that either $\\ell_+\\geq  j+m+q$ or $\\ell_-\\leq j-m-q$.\nLet $J_-=[\\ell_-+1,j-q-1]$ and $J_+=[j+q+1,\\ell_+-1]$. Note that one of these intervals can possibly be empty, but one of them has size at least $m-1$.\n\\begin{clai}\\label{clai:J}\nIn each interval $J_-$ and $J_+$, either $\\eps_i$ is identically $0$, and $\\eps'_i$ is identically $k-1$, or vice versa.\n\\end{clai}\n\\begin{proof}\nBoth cases are treated similarly, so we only consider $J_+$, which we can assume to be non empty.  \nWe have\n\\[\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{i-j}=(\\eps'_{\\ell_+}-\\eps_{\\ell_+})k^{{\\ell_+}-j}+\\sum_{i<\\ell_+}(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i)k^{i-j}.\\]\nBy symmetry, we can assume without loss of generality that $\\eps'_{\\ell_+}>\\eps_{\\ell_+}$.\nTherefore,\n\\[\\left|\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{i-j}\\right|=\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{i-j}\\geq k^{\\ell_+-j}+\\sum_{i<\\ell_+}(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i)k^{i-j}.\\]\nWe let $t$ be the maximal integer  $<\\ell_+$ such that $\\eps'_{t}-\\eps_{t}\\neq -k+1$. We have\n\\[\\left|\\sum_i(\\eps'_i-\\eps_i) k^{i-j}\\right|\\geq k^{\\ell_+-j}-(k-1)\\sum_{i=t}^{\\ell_+-1}k^{i-j}=k^{t-j}.\\]\nOn the other hand, since $d(\\vv(g'), \\vv(g))\\leq q$, we have $t-j\\leq q$. In other words, $\\eps_i'-\\eps_i=-k+1$ for all $r+j<i< \\ell_+$, hence for all $r+j<i<m+q+j$. This imposes for such values of $i$ that $\\eps_i=k-1$ and $\\eps'_i=0$, and the claim is proven.\n\\end{proof}\nIt is now straightforward to deduce our two properties from the claim. First, since the coordinates of $x$ on $J_+$ and $J_-$ are prescribed, with two possible values, the proportion of such $g\\in F_n^\\Lamp$ is at most $4k^{-m+1}$. \nSecond, if $x$ is given, we see that the coordinates of $x'$ outside the interval $[j-q,j+q]$ are determined by those of $x$. This leaves $k^{2q+1}$ possibilities for choosing $x'$, and since $|j'-j|\\leq q$, we have $(2q+1)k^{2q+1}$ for the choice of $g$. This ends the proof of the lemma.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\noindent{\\bf Second step: constructing a map from $\\Lamp_k$ and  $\\SOL_A$.} \n\nLet us describe an embedding of  $\\SOL_A$ in  $\\SOL_\\R$. We start with the obvious embedding of $\\SOL_A$ in the semi-direct product $\\R^2\\rtimes_A \\R$, where the notation means that $t\\in \\R$ acts by multiplication by the matrix $A^t$. Denote by $\\Gamma_0'$ the image of $\\SOL_A$. A relatively compact fundamental domain $D_0'$ for the action by left-translations of $\\Gamma_0$ on $\\R^2\\rtimes_A \\R$ is simply given by $[0,1)^3$.\nChoose a basis $(v_+,v_-)$ of eigenvectors of $A$ associated to the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda^{-1}$. We have an isomorphism $ \\SOL_\\R\\to \\R^2\\rtimes_A \\R$ given by \\[(a,b,t)\\mapsto (av_++bv_-, \\frac{\\log \\lambda}{\\log k}t),\\]\nwhose inverse will be denoted by $\\mathfrak{p}$. Denote $\\Gamma_0=\\mathfrak{p}(\\Gamma_0')$ and  $D_0=\\mathfrak{p}(D_0')$.  By construction, $\\Gamma_0$ is a copy of $\\SOL_A$ embedded as a lattice in $\\SOL_\\R$, and $D_0$ is a fundamental domain for its action by left-translations. Note that $D_0$\n is relatively compact, and with no-empty interior and contains the neutral element.\n\nAlthough $\\vv$ is obviously injective, its image is a priori not uniformly discrete\\footnote{It is indeed  not the case as the elements  $(x,0)$ and $(x',0)$, where $x=(k-1)1_{[-m,m]}$ and $x'=1_{\\{-m-1,m+1\\}}$ are at distance  $O(q^{-m})$ from each other.}.\nWe start modifying $\\vv$ so that while remaining injective, its image is a uniformly discrete subset of $\\SOL_\\R$. By Lemma \\ref{lem:psi},  the preimage of any (left) $\\Gamma_0$-translate of $D_0$ has cardinality bounded above by some constant $N$. In other words, every such translate of $D_0$ contains at most $N$ elements of $\\Im\\vv$. Since $D_0$ has non-empty interior, we can therefore modify $\\vv$ to a map $\\vv_0$ such that for all $g$, $\\vv_0(g)$ belongs to the same $\\Gamma_0$-translate of $D_0$ as $\\vv(g)$, and such that $\\vv_0$ has uniformly discrete image.\n\nOur next step consists in modifying $\\vv'$ further to have it land in some (different) copy of $\\SOL_A$ in $\\SOL_\\R$.  Our goal is to do it in order to get an injective map from $\\Lamp_k$ to $\\SOL_A$. \nSince we have assumed (from the beginning) that $k\\geq \\lambda$, we already have that two elements of $D_0\\cap \\Im\\vv$ have same $\\R$-coordinate, which ensures that $\\vv_0$ is already injective in restriction to the $\\Z$ coordinates.  In order to obtain an injective map, we will replace $\\Gamma_0$ by a copy which is ``denser' in the $\\R^2$-coordinate.\n\nFor all $t>0$, consider the automorphism $\\theta_t$ which multiplies the $\\R^2$-coordinate by $t$. Let $\\tau_t=\\theta_t\\circ \\tau_0$, $\\Gamma_t=\\Im(\\tau_t)$ and let $D_t=\\theta_t(D_0)$. Observe that $D_t$ is a fundamental domain for the left $\\Gamma_t$ action on $\\SOL_\\R$. Hence by choosing $t$ small enough, we can assume that the euclidean diameter of $D_t\\cap \\R^2$ is arbitrarily small. Combined with the fact that $\\Im\\vv_0$ is uniformly discrete, and that  $\\theta_t$ does not affect the $\\R$ coordinate, we can choose $t\\leq 1$ small enough so  that  every $\\Gamma_t$-translate of $D_t$  contains at most one element of $\\Im\\vv_0$. From now on, we fix such $t$ and omit the subscript $t$.\n\nWe define a map $\\uu:\\Lamp_k\\to \\Gamma$ as follows: $\\uu(g)=\\gamma\\in \\Gamma$ where $\\gamma$ is the unique element such that $\\vv_0(g)\\in \\gamma D$. Since $\\gamma D$ contains at most one element of $\\Im\\vv_0$, the map $\\uu$ is injective.\n\nNow, let $C$ be such that $D_0\\subset B_{\\SOL_\\R}(e,C/2)$. Note that we also have  $D\\subset B_{\\SOL_\\R}(e,C/2)$. \nBy construction,  $d(\\uu(g),\\vv(g))\\leq C$ for all $g\\in \\Lamp_k$ (where the distance is measured with respect to the word metric of $\\SOL_\\R$). \n\nWe let $\\mathcal G_n=F_n^\\Lamp$ and $\\mathcal H_n=F_n^{\\SOL}B_{\\SOL_\\R}(e, C)\\cap \\Gamma$. Since $\\vv$ maps $F_n^\\Lamp$ to a coarsely dense subset of $F_n^{\\SOL}$, we have that $\\uu$ maps it to a coarsely dense subset of $\\mathcal H_n$. Restricting $\\uu$ to $\\mathcal G_n$, we therefore get a sequence of maps $\\uu_n: \\mathcal G_n\\to \\mathcal H_n$.\n\nLet us check that $\\mathcal H_n$ is a F\\o lner sequence of $\\Gamma$. Let $R$ be such that $T=B_{\\SOL_\\R}(e,R)\\cap \\Gamma$ defines a generating set of $\\Gamma$. Then it is enough to prove that $\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{\\#\\mathcal{H}_nT}{\\#\\mathcal{H}_n}=1$.

So reasoning as before, using that $(\\uu_n)$ is $\\mathcal{U}$-statistically coarsely injective, we are left to show that\n\\[\\lim_\\mathcal{U}\\frac{\\#\\left\\{(y,y')\\in Y_n^2 \\mid d_{Y_n}(y,y'))\\le r+C_0,  \\diam(\\{\\uu_n(y')\\}\\cup\\vv^{-1}_n(y))\\ge C-C_0 \\right\\}}{\\#Y_n}\\]\ntends to zero as $C\\to \\infty$, for some given large enough constant $C_0$. \nif $C>0$, this forces $y$ to be in the image of $\\vv_n$, and by definition of $\\vv_n$, we have that $\\Im \\vv_n=\\Im\\vv_n\\circ \\uu_n$. \nHence there exists $y''\\in Y_n$ such that $y=\\vv_n(\\uu_n(y''))$. Again by definition of $\\vv_n$, this implies that $y\\in \\uu_n^{-1}(\\uu_n(y'')$ and therefore that $y=y''$. In conclusion we have that $\\uu_n(y)\\in \\vv_n^{-1}(y)$.\nHence the above expression is at most \n\\[\\lim_\\mathcal{U}\\frac{\\#\\left\\{(y,y')\\in Y_n^2 \\mid d_{Y_n}(y,y'))\\le r+C_0, d(\\uu_n(y'),\\uu_n(y)\\ge C-C_0 \\right\\}}{\\#Y_n},\\]\nwhich tends to zero as $C\\to \\infty$, independently of $n$, as $(\\uu_n)$ is $\\mathcal{U}$-statistically Lipschitz. This ends the proof the second statement, hence of the proposition."
