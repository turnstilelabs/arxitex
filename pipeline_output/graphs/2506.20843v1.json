By choosing matrix units, we can find a collection of partial isometries $e_i^k \\in Q^k, i\\leq d_k$ and a projection $q^k_1\\in Q^k$ satisfying $(e_i^k)^* e_j^k  =\\delta_{i,j} \\cdot q^k_1 $, such that  $q^k :=\\sum_{i=1}^{d_k} e_i^k (e_i^k)^*$ is the unit of $Q^k$ and  $Q^k = \\spam \\{e^k_i(e_j^k)^*| i, j \\leq d_k \\}$.\n    Let $q^k_i = e_i^k (e_i^k)^*$. Note that $q^k_i$, $k \\leq m, i \\leq d_k$ is a finite set of disjoint projections summing up to $1$, so we can lift it to collections of disjoint  projections $q^k_i(n) \\in M_n$, $k\\leq m,i \\leq d_k, n \\in \\N$ with $\\sum_{k,i} q^k_i(n) = 1$ for all $n$, such that $q^k_i = (q^k_i(n))_n$ as elements of the ultraproduct (see for example \\cite{HS_alg}).\n     For each $k \\leq m$, set $q^k(n) = \\sum_i q_i^k(n)$, and note that we have  $q^k = (q^k(n))_n$ as elements of the ultraproduct, and $Q^k = q^k Q q^k \\leq \\ultprod{n} q^k(n) M_n q^k(n)$.\n    \n    Now, by applying \\cite[Lemma 11.1.12]{Popa} for each $k$ separately, we deduce that for almost every $n$ there exist  partial isometries $e^k_i(n) \\in q^k(n)M_n q^k(n)$ with $e_i^k(n)^* e_j^k(n) = \\delta_{i,j} \\cdot p^k(n)$ for all $i,j,k,n$, where $p^k(n) \\in q^k(n)M_n q^k(n)$ are projections such that $p^k(n) \\leq q^k_1(n)$ and $\\ultlim{n} \\|q^k_1(n) -  p^k(n) \\|_2 =0$ and additionally, $(e^k_i(n))_n = e_i^k$ as elements of the ultraproduct, for all $k \\leq m, i \\leq d_k$.\n    Since $\\ultlim{n} \\|q^k_1(n) -  p^k(n) \\|_2 =0$, in fact $(p^k(n))_n = q^k_1$.\n    \n    It now follows that the map $\\pi_n(e_i^k) = e_i^k(n)$ extends to a (possibly non-unital) $*$-homomorphism $\\pi_n: Q \\to M_n$ for almost every $n$, yielding the desired conclusion."

      "proof": "Assume $(1)$, and let $\\varphi$ be a von Neumann amenable character. Then the von Neumann algebra of $\\varphi$ is in particular Connes embeddable. It follows that $\\varphi=\\lim_n \\frac{1}{d_n}\\mathrm{tr}\\circ \\pi_n$ for an asymptotic representation $\\pi_n:\\Gamma\\to U(d_n)$. Fix a finite generating set $\\gamma_1 ,...,\\gamma_m\\in \\Gamma$. The tuples $(\\pi_n (\\gamma_1 ),...,(\\pi_n(\\gamma)))$ converges to $(\\pi(\\gamma_1),...,\\pi(\\gamma_m))$ where $\\pi$ is the representation corresponding to $\\varphi$. Since $\\pi(\\Gamma)''$ is amenable, it is moreover hyperfinite by Connes theorem. \nIt follows from Theorem \\ref{thm:vN_Schramm} that the asymptotic representation $\\pi_n$ is hyperfinite. Thus, as $\\Gamma$ hyperfinitely Hilbert--Schmidt stable, there exists a sequence of genuine representations $\\rho_n:\\Gamma\\to U(d_n)$ with $\\|\\pi_n(\\gamma)-\\rho_n(\\gamma)\\|\\to 0$ for all $\\gamma\\in \\Gamma$. It follows that $\\varphi$ is a limit of finite-dimensional traces\n$$\\varphi=\\lim_n \\frac{1}{d_n}\\mathrm{tr}\\circ \\pi_n=\\lim_n \\frac{1}{d_n}\\mathrm{tr}\\circ \\rho_n $$\n\nThe argument for the other direction is a combination of Theorem \\ref{thm:vN_Schramm}  with the argument given in \\cite[Theorem 4]{HS_grp}, as follows. \n    Suppose $\\pi_n: \\Gamma \\to U(d_n)$ is a hyperfinite asymptotic representation of $\\Gamma$. It is enough to show that any subsequence of $\\pi_n$ admits a further subsequence which can be corrected to a genuine sequence of representation. Thus, consider a subsequence of $\\pi_{n_m}$, and let $(M_m;\\bar{x}_m)$ be the corresponding marked von Neumann algebras. By  compactness, we may extract a subsequence  $(M_{m_l};\\bar{x}_{m_l})$ which converges to a limit $(M,\\bar{x})$. By Theorem \\ref{thm:vN_Schramm}, $M$ is amenable. Moreover, since $\\pi_{n_{m_l}}$ are asymptotic representations, the map $\\pi:\\Gamma\\to U(M)$ corresponding to the marked von Neumann algebra $(M,\\bar{x})$ is a genuine representation. \n    It follows that $\\varphi=\\tau_M \\circ \\pi$ is a trace, and by assumption, it is a limit of of finite-dimensional traces $\\varphi_l=\\frac{1}{d_l'}\\mathrm{tr}\\circ \\rho_l$ for some $d_l' \\in \\N $ and some representations $\\rho_l:\\Gamma\\to U(d_l' )$. \n    \n    While there is no reason to expect that $d_{l'} = d_{n_{m_l}}$, by replacing $\\rho_l$  by a direct sum of $\\rho_l$ with itself, and  adding the trivial representation to if  necessary, we get a new representation whose trace also converges to $\\varphi$, and whose dimension is the same as of $\\pi_{n_{m_l}}$ (see \\cite[Lemma 3.7]{HS_alg}). \n    We are thus in the situation that $ \\rho_l$ and $\\pi_{n_{m_l}}$ are of equal dimensions and they converge to the same limiting trace $\\varphi$, which generates a hyperfinite algebra. We can now apply \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{HS_alg}, to find unitaries $u_l \\in U(d_{n_{m_l}})$ such that $\\pi_{n_{m_l}}$ and the conjugates of the form $\\mathrm{Ad}_{u_l}\\circ \\rho_l$ satisfy $\\| \\pi_{n_{m_l}}(g) - \\mathrm{Ad}_{u_l}(\\rho_l(g)) \\|_2 \\to_l 0$.\n    Then  $\\mathrm{Ad}_{u_l}\\circ \\rho_l$  are the desired representations, thus proving hyperfinite HS-stability."

      "proof": "The equivalence of $(1)$ and $(2)$ is straightforward, and we leave it to the reader. \n    The equivalence of $(3)$ and $(4)$ follows from the standard characterization of spectral gap for Laplacians, see \\cite[Proposition I]{dlHRV} and \\cite[Proposition 1.1.9]{BdlV}.\n    \n    We now prove $(2) \\implies (3)$. \n    Fix $\\lambda$ as in Definition \\ref{def:robust}.\n    Let $\\varphi \\in \\Tr{\\Gamma}$ be a trace such that $M_\\varphi = \\pi_\\varphi(\\Gamma) ''$ is in $\\cP$.\n    That is, there is a sequence $(M_n,\\tau_n) \\in \\cQ$ such that $M_\\varphi \\leq \\ultprod{n} M_n$.\n    In this case, there exists an asymptotic representation $\\pi_n: \\Gamma \\to U(M_n)$ such that the tuples $(\\pi_n(s_1), \\dots , \\pi_n(s_k))_n$ converge in moments to the tuples $(\\pi_\\varphi(s_1),\\dots ,\\pi_\\varphi(s_k))$ (see \\cite[Theorem 7]{OzawaConnes}).\n    Further, we can modify $\\pi_n$ so that that $\\pi_n(s_i^{-1}) = \\pi_n(s_i)^{-1}$ for each $i$, as is done in \\cite[Section 3.1]{DGLT}.\n    As such, by $(2)$ it follows that for every $\\alpha> 0$ we have $\\tau_n(\\chi_{[\\alpha,\\lambda-\\alpha]}(\\pi_n(\\Delta_S))) \\to_n 0$. Using Proposition \\ref{prop:spec_gap_pass_to_limit}, we see that $\\pi_{\\varphi}(\\Delta_S)$ has $\\lambda$-spectral gap.\n    \n    Let us now prove $(3) \\implies (2)$.\n    Fix $\\lambda > 0$ which satisfies the condition in $(3)$, and assume by contradiction that $\\Gamma$ does not satisfy $(2)$. \n    As such, there is an asymptotic representation $\\pi_n: \\Gamma \\to U(M_n)$, for some $(M_n,\\tau_n) \\in \\cQ$ and $0 < \\alpha<\\lambda$ such that $\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} \\tau_n(\\chi_{[\\alpha,\\lambda-\\alpha]}(\\pi_n(\\Delta_{S}))) > 0 $.\n    By compactness of the space of $k$-marked von Neumann algebras (see Section \\ref{subsec:marked}),  there is a subsequence of the tuples $((\\pi_n(s_1), \\dots , \\pi_n(s_k))_n$ that converge in moments to a tuple $(\\pi_\\varphi({s}_1), \\dots, \\pi_{\\varphi}({s}_k))$, where $\\varphi$ is a trace on the free group $\\mathbb F_S$ and $\\pi_\\varphi: \\F_S \\to U(M_\\varphi)$ is the GNS-construction.\n    By replacing $\\pi_n$ with this subsequence, and simply assume convergence holds.\n    Now, since $\\pi_n$ is an asymptotic representation,  it follows that in fact $\\varphi \\in \\Tr{\\Gamma} \\subset \\Tr{\\F_S}$, so that $\\pi_\\varphi$ in fact factors to a $\\Gamma$-representation $\\pi_\\varphi: \\Gamma \\to U(M_\\varphi)$ . \n    Further, as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:vN_Schramm}, we see that $M_\\varphi$ embeds in $\\ultprod{n} M_n$, so $M_\\varphi \\in \\cP$.\n    Consequently, by the condition in $(3)$ we  have $\\mu((0,\\lambda)) = \\tau(\\chi_{(0,\\lambda)}(\\pi_\\varphi(\\Delta_S))) = 0$.\n    Together with convergence and Proposition \\ref{prop:spec_gap_pass_to_limit}, we see that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\tau_n(\\chi_{[\\alpha,\\lambda-\\alpha]}(\\pi_n(\\Delta_{S}))) = 0$, contradiction."

      "proof": "We claim that $\\| U_i T^*TU_i^* - T^*T \\|_{\\tr}< 2\\epsilon$ for all $i$. Indeed, we have $\\| U_iT^*U_i^* - T^* \\|_{F}  < \\epsilon$, and so\n   \n   \\begin{align*}\n       \\|U_i T^*U_i^*U_iT U_i^* - T^*T \\|_{\\tr} &\\leq \\| (U_i T^* U_i^* - T^*) U_i T U_i^* \\|_{\\tr} + \\| T^*(U_iTU_i^* - T) \\|_{\\tr}\\\\\n       &\\leq \\| (U_i T^* U_i^* - T^*) \\|_F\\| U_i T U_i^* \\|_F\\\\\n       &+ \\| T^* \\|_F \\|(U_iTU_i^* - T) \\|_{F} \\\\\n       &< 2\\epsilon.\n   \\end{align*}\n       Note that we used the inequality $\\|A B\\|_{\\tr} \\leq \\|A \\|_F\\|B\\|_F$ for $A,B \\in HS(\\cH)$. \n       Now, by the Powers-St\u00f8rmer inequality \\cite[Proposition 6.2.4]{BO}, we have\n       $$ \\| U_i |T|U_i^* - |T| \\|_F \\leq \\| U_i T^*T U_i^* - T^*T\\|_{\\tr}^{1/2} \\leq \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}.$$\n       Denote by $S = |T|$, and note that it is a positive Hilbert--Schmidt operator. Since $\\| T -\\xi \\otimes \\bar\\xi \\|_{F} < \\theta_0$ and $(\\xi \\otimes \\bar \\xi) = (\\xi \\otimes \\bar \\xi)^* = |(\\xi \\otimes \\bar \\xi)|$, by a similar analysis to above we get that $\\|S - \\xi \\otimes \\bar{\\xi} \\|_F < \\sqrt{2\\theta_0}$ . \n       \n       Note that we in particular have $\\| U_i S U_i^* - S \\|_{\\op} < \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$,  and $\\| S \\|_F = 1$.\n       Let $\\lambda_1$ be the largest eigenvalue of $S$, we have $\\lambda_1 = \\| S \\|_{\\op}$. Since $\\| S - \\xi \\otimes \\bar\\xi \\|_{op}  < \\sqrt{2\\theta_0}$, so $ \\lambda_1 > 1 - \\sqrt{2\\theta_0}$. \n       Moreover $\\mathrm{mult}(\\lambda_1)$, the multiplicity of  $\\lambda_1$, satisfies $\\mathrm{mult}(\\lambda_1) (1- \\sqrt{2\\theta_0})^2< \\mathrm{mult}(\\lambda_1) \\lambda_1^2\\leq \\| S \\|_F^2 = 1$, and therefore $\\mathrm{mult}(\\lambda_1)=1$.\n\n    \n       By the spectral theorem for self-adjoint compact operators, there exists an orthonormal basis $e_n$, so that $$S = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\lambda_n e_n \\otimes \\bar{e}_n,$$ and $\\lambda_1 > \\lambda_2 \\geq\\lambda_3 \\dots\\geq 0$  is the decreasing  sequence of (possibly repeated) eigenvalues.  Denote $R=\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\lambda_ne_n\\otimes \\bar e_n$. Since $\\lambda_1^2> (1-\\sqrt{2\\theta_0})^2$ and $\\|S\\|_F^2=1$, we have by Pythagoras that $\\| R \\|_{\\op}^2 \\leq \\|R\\|_F^2=\\sum_{n\\geq 2} |\\lambda_n|^2<1-(1-\\sqrt{2\\theta_0})^2$.\n       Fix $i$, and we will show that $|\\langle U_ie_1, e_1\\rangle| \\geq \\sqrt{1-8\\epsilon}$, then taking $\\eta = e_1$ we will have proved the claim.\n       Denote  $v = U_ie_1$, and write $v = \\langle v,e_1 \\rangle e_1  + w$, where $w \\in \\overline{\\spam\\{e_n | n \\geq 2\\}}$. \n       Then since $\\| U_i S U_i^* - S \\|_{\\op} < \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$ we have \n       \\begin{align*}\n           \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}&> \\|U_iSU_i^*v - Sv \\| =\\|\\lambda_1 v - Rv \\|\\\\\n           &= \\| \\lambda_1  \\langle v,e_1 \\rangle e_1  + \\lambda_1w  - \\lambda_1  \\langle v,e_1 \\rangle e_1  - Sw \\| \\\\\n           &= \\| \\lambda_1w - Rw \\|\\\\\n           &\\geq \\|\\lambda_1w\\| - \\|Rw\\| \\\\\n           &\\geq (\\lambda_1 - \\sqrt{1-(1-\\sqrt{2\\theta_0})^2})\\| w\\|\\\\\n           &\\geq (1 - \\sqrt{2\\theta_0} -\\sqrt{1-(1-\\sqrt{2\\theta_0})^2}) \\|w\\|\\\\\n           &\\geq (1/2) \\| w\\|\n       \\end{align*}\n   Where we used that $1 - \\sqrt{2\\theta_0} -\\sqrt{1-(1-\\sqrt{2\\theta_0})^2} > \\frac{1}{2}$ in the last inequality.

As such, by Proposition \\ref{prop:rigidity_almost_rep}  there exists unit vectors $\\xi_n \\in \\tilde q_n \\widetilde{M}_n$ of uniformly bounded operator norm such that $\\| \\xi_n - \\tilde q_n \\|_{2, \\widetilde{M}_n} / \\| \\tilde q_n\\|_{2, \\widetilde{M}_n} < \\delta$, and$\\|\\tilde \\pi_n(g)\\xi_n \\tilde \\rho_n(g)^* - \\xi_n \\|_{2,\\widetilde M_n} / \\| \\tilde q_n \\|_{2,\\widetilde M_n} \\to_{n} 0$ for all $g \\in \\Gamma$.\n          \n           \n           \n           Consequently, for each $n$ large enough we can use Corollary \\ref{cor:Connes_trick_vN} (with $u_i, v_i$ being the unitaries $\\pi_n(g)$, $\\rho_n(g)$, $g\\in \\Gamma$ respectively)  to find a sequence of unit vectors $\\eta_n \\in q_nM_n$, for which $\\| \\eta_n \\|_{\\op} \\leq 2 \\|\\xi_n \\|_{\\op} / \\| q_n \\|_{2,M_n}$ and for all $g \\in \\Gamma$:\n           $$|\\langle \\pi_n(g) \\eta_n\\rho_n(g)^*, \\eta_n \\rangle_{2,M_n} / \\|q_n \\|_{2,M_n}^2|  \\to _n 1.$$ \n           Note that since $\\liminf_{n} \\| q_n \\|_{2,M_n} > 0$, we also have that $\\eta_n$ is uniformly bounded in operator norm.\n           \n    \n        \n        For every $g \\in \\Gamma$, set $\\lambda_n(g) \\in \\T$ to  be the unique scalar such that such that $\\langle \\pi_n(g) \\eta_n\\rho_n(g)^*, \\lambda_n(g)\\eta_n \\rangle_{2,M_n} > 0$.\n        Then for every $g \\in \\Gamma$, $\\| \\pi_n(g)\\eta_n \\rho_n(g)^* - \\lambda_n(g)\\eta_n \\|_{2,M_n} / \\| q_n\\|_{2,M_n} \\to_n 0$.\n        Let $C$ be a uniform bound on the operator norm of $\\eta_n$,  and note that we have:\n        \\begin{align*}\n            \\| c(g,h)\\pi_n(g)\\pi_n(h)&\\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* - \\pi_n(gh) \\eta_n \\rho_n(gh)^*\\|_{2,M_n} \\\\\n            & \\leq \\|(c(g,h)\\pi_n(g)\\pi_n(h) - \\pi_n(gh)) \\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* \\|_{2,M_n} \\\\\n            & \\; + \\| \\pi_n(gh) \\eta_n (\\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* -\\rho_n(gh)^*) \\|_{2,M_n}\\\\\n            & \\leq C\\|c(g,h)\\pi_n(g)\\pi_n(h) - \\pi_n(gh)\\|_{2,M_n} \\\\\n            & \\; + C\\|  \\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* -\\rho_n(gh)^* \\|_{2,M_n}.\n        \\end{align*}\n        After normalizing the above inequality by $\\| q_n \\|_{2,M_n}$, we see the rightmost term converges to $0$. Thus we  have $\\| c(g,h)\\pi_n(g)\\pi_n(h)\\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* - \\lambda_n(gh) \\eta_n \\|_{2,M_n} / \\| q_n \\|_{2,M_n} \\to_n 0$.\n        Further, we have for all $g,h \\in \\Gamma$:\n        \\begin{align*}\n             \\| c(g,h)\\lambda_n(h) &\\lambda_n(g)\\eta_n -\\lambda_n(gh)\\eta_n\\|_{2,M_n}\\\\\n             &\\leq \\| c(g,h)\\lambda_n(h) (\\pi_n(g) \\eta_n \\rho_n(g)^* - \\lambda_n(g)\\eta_n)\\|_{2,M_n}\\\\ \n             &\\;+ \\| c(g,h) (\\pi_n(g) (\\pi_n(h) \\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^* - \\lambda_n(h)\\eta_n) \\rho_n(g)^*)\\|_{2,M_n}\\\\ \n            &+ \\| c(g,h)\\pi_n(g)\\pi_n(h)\\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* -\\lambda_n(gh)\\eta_n\\|_{2,M_n}\\\\\n            &\\leq \\|\\pi_n(g) \\eta_n \\rho_n(g)^* - \\lambda_n(g)\\eta_n \\|_{2,M_n}\\\\\n            &\\;+\\|\\pi_n(h) \\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^* - \\lambda_n(h)\\eta_n \\|_{2,M_n}\\\\\n            &+ \\| c(g,h)\\pi_n(g)\\pi_n(h)\\eta_n \\rho_n(h)^*\\rho_n(g)^* -\\lambda_n(gh)\\eta_n\\|_{2,M_n}.\\\\\n        \\end{align*} \n        Again, after normalizing the inequality by $\\| q_n \\|_{2,M_n}$, we see the rightmost term converges to $0$. Since $\\| \\eta_n \\|_{2,M_n} / \\| q_n\\|_{2,M_n} = 1$, we have that for every $g,h \\in \\Gamma$, $\\lim_n \\lambda_n(g)^{-1}\\lambda_n(h)^{-1} \\lambda_n(gh) = c(g,h)$. \n        Since $\\T^\\Gamma$ is compact, we can take a partial pointwise limit $\\lambda: \\Gamma \\to \\T$ of $\\lambda_n$.\n        It then follows that $\\lambda(g) \\lambda(h) \\lambda(gh)^{-1} = c(g,h)$ for all $g,h \\in \\Gamma$, so $c$ is a $2$-coboundary."
