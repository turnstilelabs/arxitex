We may write $N_i\\cong T_i^{n_i}$ for some simple group $T_i$, and note that $T_i$ must be nonabelian since $N_i$ is not solvable. In particular, $Z(N_i)=1$. Now, for $i\\neq j$, $N_i\\cap N_j=1$, and so elements of $N_i$ and $N_j$ commute, meaning that elements of $N_i$ and $\\prod_{j\\neq i}N_j$ commute.

This means, $Z_G(N)=1$, and so we can embed $G$ into $\\Aut(N)$.\n\nFinally, since each $N_i$ is normal in $G$, it is fixed by the action of $G$, so that the image of $G$ lies in\n$$\\Aut(N_1)\\times\\cdots\\times\\Aut(N_r)\\leq\\Aut(T_1^{n_1}\\times\\cdots\\times T_r^{n_r}),$$\nas desired."

      "proof": "The value $\\gcd(\\chi(1),\\chi^c(1))$ is square-free if and only if for every prime $p,$ $p^2$ does not divide both $\\chi(1)$ and $\\chi^c(1).$ Note also that since $\\Out(\\PSL_2(q))$ is abelian and $S$ is the unique minimal normal subgroup of $H,$ any representation is either linear or satisfies $\\chi^c(1)=|G|/\\chi(1).$ From here we proceed by casework.\n\n    For an odd prime power $q=p^f,$ the character degree $q$ and its corresponding codegree have $\\gcd$ a multiple of $p^2$ only when $\\frac{|G|}{q},$ equal to $(q^2-1)d$ up to powers of 2, is a multiple of $p^2.$ $q,q-1,q+1$ have no pairwise common factors except for possibly 2, and in particular this condition requires $p^2\\mid d.$ All other characters similarly have $p^2$ never dividing the $\\gcd$ or dividing it only when $p^2\\mid d.$ Conversely, the degree $q$ always works when $p^2\\mid d$; for $\\PSL_2(q)$ only has an extension of index $p^2$ when $q$ has more than one factor of $p,$ implying $p^2\\mid\\gcd(q,|G|/q).$\n\n    For an odd prime $r\\neq p,$ $r^2$ dividing the degree and codegree implies that $r^4\\mid |G|,$ or (since $q$ and any factors of $2$ are relatively prime to $r^4$) that $r^4\\mid (q^2-1)d.$ Furthermore, if $r^2\\nmid d,$ then the remaining of $r$ must lie in $q-1$ and $q+1.$ Since these two cannot share a factor of $r,$ all but at most one factor of $r$ lies in either the degree or the codegree: for in every possible case, the character degree has all the factors of $r$ in $q-1$ but none in $q+1,$ all the factors in $q+1$ but none in $q-1,$ or neither. In all these cases, the degree or codegree without the factors of $r$ associated to $q^2-1$ will have at most one factor of $r$ in it, so that $r^2$ does not divide one of the two sides.\n\n    Conversely, when $r^2\\mid d$ and $r^4\\mid (q^2-1)d,$ consider the character degrees $(q-1)2^ar^2$ and $(q+1)r^2$; these are valid since $\\ell,j=1,j=2$ cannot equal $q^2.$ Since $q-1$ and $q+1$ share no factors of $r,$ one of $q-1$ and $q+1$ is not a multiple of $r.$ It follows that $r^2$ exactly divides one of the given degrees, and so the corresponding codegree is also a multiple of $r^4/r^2=r^2$. Thus their $\\gcd$ is a multiple of $r^2.$\n\n    For $q$ a power of 2, the trivial $\\delta$ is in $H$ in all cases, and a degree of $q$ yields codegree $(q^2-1)d$; similarly to above, the gcd here can only be even when $4\\mid d,$ as with all other degrees, and since $q>3,$ $\\gcd(q,|G|/q)$ is a multiple of $4.$\n\n    For $q$ an odd prime power, significant casework is required covering the value of $p$ mod $8$ and whether $\\delta\\in H.$ When $\\delta\\in H,$ $|G|=q(q^2-1)d,$ while when $\\delta\\not\\in H, |G|=q(q^2-1)d/2.$ The degrees of $1,q,(q+\\varepsilon)/2$ are always odd and therefore irrelevant. A case-by-case study of the possibilities for 2 gives the $2\\nmid d$ and $4\\nmid d$ restrictions listed above. Most of the exceptions have no effect on our square-free case, generally coinciding with already-disallowed values for $d$. Only the last one has an effect: when $p=3,f=2,j=2,d=2,$ the groups $H=S\\langle\\varphi\\rangle$ and $H=S\\langle\\delta\\varphi\\rangle$ have no $j=2$ character, corresponding to the extensions $M_{10}$ and $S_6$ of $\\PSL_2(9).$\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item When $q \\equiv 1\\,(\\textrm{mod}\\ 8)$, the codegrees corresponding to $(q-1)2^a\\ell,$ namely $q(q+1)\\cdot m/\\ell$ or $q(q+1)/2\\cdot m/\\ell,$ cannot be multiples of 4. $(q+1)j$ is a multiple of $4$ if and only if $j$ is even, and the corresponding codegrees $q(q-1)\\cdot d/j$ and $q(q-1)/2\\cdot d/j$ are multiples of 4. Thus we have a $\\gcd$ which is a multiple of 4 iff there exists an even choice for $j$. For $j$ to be even requires that $d$ be even. Conversely, if $d$ is even, we may attempt to choose $j=d$; this is only disallowed when $d=2,$ $p=2$ or $3,$ and $f$ is $2$ mod 4. For an odd prime power, this can only be $S=\\PSL_2(3^{4n+2}).$ $H=S\\langle\\varphi\\rangle$ and $H=S\\langle\\delta\\varphi\\rangle$ do not contain $\\delta,$ and so the index of $S$ within them is precisely $d=4n+2.$ That is, we have exceptions to $\\PSL_2(9)$ with the extensions of order $2$ not containing $\\delta$; these are $M_{10}$ and $S_6$, which indeed satisfy our square-free condition.\n        \\item When $q \\equiv 3\\,(\\textrm{mod}\\ 8)$, $(q-1)2^a\\ell$ is a multiple of 4 iff $d$ is even; when $\\delta\\in H,$ the codegree $q(q+1)\\cdot m/\\ell$ is a multiple of 4, while for $\\delta\\not\\in H,$ $q(q+1)/2\\cdot m/\\ell$ is not a multiple of 4. $(q+1)j$ is always a multiple of 4 while $q(q-1)\\cdot d/j$ can be a multiple of $4$ iff $d$ is even and $q(q-1)/2\\cdot d/j$ can be a multiple of $4$ iff $d$ is a multiple of $4.$ Not counting exceptions, then, we have the condition $2\\nmid d$ for $\\delta\\in H$ and $4\\nmid d$ for $\\delta\\not\\in H.$ Exceptions 2 through 4 above must be considered; since $\\delta\\not\\in S\\langle\\varphi\\rangle,$ we need only consider exception 3 for $\\delta\\in H,$ which has no effect on the $(q-1)2^a\\ell$ degree that matters for $\\delta\\in H.$ For $\\delta\\not\\in H,$ $\\ell=1$ and $j=1$ are disallowed; we only care about $(q+1)j$ here, and when $4\\mid d,$ $f$ must be even. Thus no exceptions apply here.\n        \\item When $q \\equiv 5\\,(\\textrm{mod}\\ 8)$, the codegrees corresponding to $(q-1)2^a\\ell,$ namely $q(q+1)\\cdot m/\\ell$ or $q(q+1)/2\\cdot m/\\ell,$ cannot be multiples of 4. $(q+1)j$ is a multiple of 4 iff $j$ is even; when $\\delta\\in H,$ the codegree $q(q-1)\\cdot d/j$ is always a multiple of 4, while for $\\delta\\not\\in H,$ the codegree $q(q-1)/2\\cdot d/j$ is a multiple of 4 iff $d/j$ is even. These correspond to the conditions $2\\nmid d$ for $\\delta\\in H$ and $4=(2\\cdot2)\\nmid (j\\cdot d/j)=d.$ The only exception that could apply here is exception 4, in which $p=5$ and $f$ is odd; since we care only about $j$ even, the $j\\neq 1$ restriction does not matter, so no restrictions apply.\n        \\item When $q \\equiv 7\\,(\\textrm{mod}\\ 8)$, $(q-1)2^a\\ell$ is a multiple of 4 iff $d$ is even, while the possible codegrees $q(q+1)\\cdot m/\\ell$ and $q(q+1)/2\\cdot m/\\ell$ are always multiples of 4. $(q+1)j$ is always a multiple of 4 while $q(q-1)\\cdot d/j$ can be a multiple of $4$ iff $d$ is even and $q(q-1)/2\\cdot d/j$ can be a multiple of $4$ iff $d$ is a multiple of $4.$ The former conditions are stronger, so the condition we want here is $2\\nmid d.$\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    These are all the necessary conditions for our $\\gcd$ to be square-free."
