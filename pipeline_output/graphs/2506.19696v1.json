      "proof": "Consider a QRT where the free operations arise from a representation $R$ of a Lie group $G$ with associated Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. Then, let $\\rho=\\dya{\\psi}$ with $\\ket{\\psi}$ a free, or generalized coherent state. By definition, there exists a unitary $U\\in R(G)$ such that $\\ket{\\psi}=U\\ket{{\\rm hw}}$, where $\\ket{{\\rm hw}}$ is the highest (or lowest) weight of $R(\\mathfrak{g})$. \n    \nTo begin, let us show that if a pure state $\\sigma=\\dya{\\phi}$ solves the MaxEnt problem of Eq.~\\eqref{eq:max-ent} for $\\Lambda=\\dim(\\mathfrak{g})$, then $\\ket{\\phi}$ is a generalized coherent state. We note that  all the expectation values in the irrep $\\mathbb{C}R(\\mathfrak{g})$ for $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ match (as per the statement of Theorem~\\ref{prop:compress-si}), then we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\PC_{\\mathbb{C}R(\\mathfrak{g})}(\\sigma)=\\PC_{\\mathbb{C}R(\\mathfrak{g})}(\\rho)\\,,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich simply follows from Definition~\\ref{def:irrep-purity}. Then simply using   Theorem~\\ref{theo:algebra-purity} (see Ref.~\\cite{barnum2004subsystem} for its proof), we have that $\\ket{\\phi}$ is a free, generalized coherent, state.\n\nNext, we need to show that all other expectation values can be obtained from those in $\\mathbb{C}R(\\mathfrak{g})$. This is known as Wick's theorem, whose proof we briefly sketch here. We also refer the reader to Ref.~\\cite{somma2005quantum}. Without loss of generality, Let $R(\\g)=\\mathfrak{h}\\oplus \\mathfrak{g}_+\\oplus \\mathfrak{g}_-$ be the Cartan-Weyl decomposition of $R(\\mathfrak{g})$ (where, on the right-hand side, we have left the representation notation implicit.). Here,  $\\mathfrak{h}={\\rm span}_\\mathbb{R}i\\{H_k\\}$ denotes the Cartan subalgebra, and $\\mathfrak{g}_+={\\rm span}_\\mathbb{R}i\\{E_{\\alpha }\\}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_-={\\rm span}_\\mathbb{R}i\\{E_{-\\alpha }\\}$ the spaces of raising and lowering operators, respectively. We will assume, without loss of generality that $\\ket{\\phi}$ is the highest weight for this particular choice of Cartan $\\mathfrak{h}$.  As such, we know that the following equation holds\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:cases}\nE_{\\alpha}\\ket{\\phi}=\\bra{\\phi}E_{-\\alpha }=0,\\quad \\forall \\alpha\\quad \\text{and} \\quad H_k\\ket{\\phi}=h_k\\ket{\\phi}\\,,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $h_k$ are the weights of $\\ket{\\phi}$. Then, let $O=O_1 O_2\\cdots O_M$, with $O_1,O_2,\\cdots,O_M\\in iR(\\g)$ be operators in the algebra. When computing the expectation value $\\bra{\\phi}O_1 O_2\\cdots O_k\\ket{\\phi}$ (which correspond to all non-trivially-zero expectation values) we decompose each of the operators into elements of the Cartan, as well as lowering and raising operators. That is,\n\\begin{equation}\n    O_j=\\sum_k c_k^j H_k  +\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha^j E_\\alpha+{c_\\alpha^{j}}^* E_{-\\alpha}\\,.\n\\end{equation}\nConsequently, their products can be expressed in terms of summations of products of  elements of the Cartan, lowering and raising operators. Given that these act on the highest-weight vector $\\ket{\\phi}$, only a few of those terms will be non-zero as per Eq.~\\eqref{eq:cases}. For instance, when $M=2$, terms of the form $\\bra{\\Phi}H_k H_{k'}\\ket{\\phi}$ and $\\bra{\\Phi}E_\\alpha E_{-\\alpha}\\ket{\\phi}$ are non-zero, whereas terms such as $\\bra{\\Phi}E_{-\\alpha} E_{\\alpha}\\ket{\\phi}$ or $\\bra{\\Phi}E_{\\alpha} E_{\\alpha}\\ket{\\phi}$ vanish. In fact, we can always use the algebra's commutation relations to ``move to the left'' all the lowering operators and ``move to the right'' all the raising operators, as these\nwill vanish when acting on the highest-weight state. At the end of the day, this will lead to an expectation value which only depends on the components of the root vector and the algebra's structure coefficients, indicating that any expectation value of the form $\\bra{\\phi}O_1 O_2\\cdots O_k\\ket{\\phi}$ will be determined by the expectation values in $R(\\mathfrak{g})$. Since those values match to those in $\\ket{\\psi}$, we find that all expectation values for $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ match, indicating that these two states are equal."
