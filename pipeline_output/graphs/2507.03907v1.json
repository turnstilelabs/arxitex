      "proof": "It is easy to see that $S(A,f)$ is a normal subgroup. To see that it is simple, it suffices to show that the normal subgroup generated by any nontrivial element of $S(A,f)$ must be the whole group. For this, fix a nontrivial $t \\in H_i$. Let $N_t$ be the normal subgroup generated by $t$ in $S(A,f)$. Then $N_t \\cap H_j \\ni t$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $H_j$ for all $j\\geq i$. Since we have assumed that $H_j=H$ is simple, $N_t \\cap H_j =H_j$ and thus $N_t = S(A,f)$. This shows that $S(A,f)$ is simple. \n\n    Now assume $G$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $D(A,f)$. Let $(e_A,e_H)\\neq (s,t)\\in G\\cap G_i$. We may assume that $t\\neq e_H$ since otherwise we can do the same argument to $\\varphi_i(s,t)=(s,f(s,t)) \\in G\\cap G_{i+1}$. The group $H$ has trivial center. Thus we can choose $t'\\in H_i$ such that $t$ and $t'$ do not commute. Then $(s,t)\\neq (s,t't{t'}^{-1})=(e_A,t')(s,t)(e_A,t'^{-1})\\in G\\cap G_i$. Let $a=t'tt'^{-1}t^{-1}$. Then $a\\in H_i$ is nontrivial and $(e_A,a)\\in G\\cap H_i$ (identify $H_i$ with $\\{e_A\\}\\times H_i$). What we have shown so far is that if $G\\cap G_i$ is nontrivial, then for all $j>i$, $G\\cap H_j$ is nontrivial. Now by the argument in the preceding paragraph, the normal subgroup of $D(A, f)$ generated by any nontrivial element of $H_j$ is $S(A, f)$. Since $G$ is normal, it follows that $G$ contains $S(A, f)$.\n\n\n\n    The last assertion  follows immediately."

      "proof": "Recall that $\\Gamma(G)$ is generated by $G$. Without loss of generality we can assume $G=S(G)\\subseteq \\mathcal{R}$. We prove that the embedding of generators of $\\Gamma(G)$ to generators of $\\Gamma(\\mathcal{R})$ induces an embedding from $\\Gamma(G)$ onto $\\Gamma'(G)$. First note that since $\\mathbf{2}_{x\\in \\mathcal{R}}C_p$ and $\\mathbf{2}_{x\\in G} C_p$ are both free among groups of nilpotnent class 2 and exponent $p$, the embedding of generators naturally induces an embedding from the latter into the former. Thus we may assume that the latter is contained in the former. \n    Now let $N_G=\\langle[x,y]\\colon x,y\\in G, xGy \\rangle$ and $N_{\\mathcal{R}}=\\langle[x,y]\\colon x,y\\in \\mathcal{R}, x\\mathcal{R}y \\rangle$. We define $f:\\Gamma(G) \\to \\Gamma'(G)$ as follows. For $g\\in \\mathbf{2}_{x\\in G}C_p$, we set $f(gN_G)=gN_\\mathcal{R}$. Then it suffices to show that $f$ is a well-defined group embedding. \n\n    For the well-definedness, let $g,h\\in \\mathbf{2}_{x\\in G}C_p$ and suppose that $h^{-1}g\\in N_G$. Then since $G$ is a subgraph of $\\mathcal{R}$, $h^{-1}g\\in N_\\mathcal{R}$. Thus $f$ is well-defined. Obviously, $f$ is a homomorphism. Thus we only need to show that $f$ is injective. For this let $g\\in \\mathbf{2}_{x\\in G}C_p$ and suppose that $f(gN_G)=gN_\\mathcal{R}=N_\\mathcal{R}$, i.e., $g\\in N_\\mathcal{R}$. We need to show that $g\\in N_G$. Here we need a property of the free nilpontent-class-2, exponent-$p$ group. As remarked in \\cite{Me}, the center of $\\mathbf{2}_{x\\in G}C_p$ is a free abelian $p$-group generated by $\\{[x,y]\\colon x\\neq y \\in G\\}$. Similarly for $\\mathbf{2}_{x\\in \\mathcal{R}}C_p$. \n    Thus if $g\\in N_\\mathcal{R}$, then $g$ is in the center of $\\mathbf{2}_{x\\in \\mathcal{R}}C_p$. Thus it is also in the center of $\\mathbf{2}_{x\\in G}C_p$ which means that there are $x_i,y_i\\in G$ and $0<k_i<p$ such that $g=[x_0,y_0]^{k_0}\\dots[x_n,y_n]^{k_n}$. Also since $g\\in N_\\mathcal{R}$, there are $x_i',y_i'\\in\\mathcal{R}$ such that $x_i'\\mathcal{R}y_i'$ and $0<k_i'<p$ such that $g=[x_0',y_0']^{k_i'}\\dots[x_m',y_m']^{k_i'}$. But then these two representations must be the same due to the freeness. Thus $x_iGy_i$ for all $i$ and $g\\in N_G$. \n\n    For the moreover part, if $G\\cong H$, then by Theorem \\ref{graph extension}, there is an automorphism of $\\mathcal{R}$ sending $S(G)$ onto $S(H)$. Then this automorphism induces an automorphism of $\\Gamma(\\mathcal{R})$ sending $\\Gamma'(G)$ onto $\\Gamma'(H)$. Conversely, if there is such an automorphism, then $\\Gamma(G)\\cong \\Gamma'(G)\\cong \\Gamma'(H)\\cong \\Gamma(H)$. Thus by Theorem \\ref{me} (2), $G\\cong H$."
