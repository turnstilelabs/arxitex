As $ G $ has the ICC property, the subgroup $ C _{G} (f) $ has infinite index, so Lemma \\ref{lemma:Linf-decay} implies $ \\mathbb{P}(w_nfw_n^{-1} \\in F^2) \\to 0 $. Applying the union bound over $ f \\in F^2 \\setminus \\{ e \\} $ we see that $ \\mathbb{P}(w_n \\text{ is } F\\text{-switching}) $ tends to 1. \n\n\tNow suppose that $\\mu$ is non-degenerate. \n\tFor $ x,y \\in F $, let $ S _{x \\to y} = \\{ g \\in G, gxg = y \\}  $, so by the union bound we are done if we show that $ \\mathbb{P}(w _{n} \\in S _{x \\to y}) \\to 0 $ for all $ (x,y) \\neq (e,e) $.\n\n\tSuppose for the sake of contradiction that $ \\limsup \\mathbb{P}(w _{n} \\in S _{x,y}) > 0   $ for some $ (x,y) \\neq (e,e) $. Let $ g \\in S _{x,y} $, then any element $ h $ contained in $ g ^{-1} S _{x,y}$ must be in the centralizer of $ (xg) ^{2}  $ (see \\cite[Proposition 2.5]{frisch2019choquet}). Since $ \\limsup \\mathbb{P}(w_n \\in S _{x,y}) > 0 $, then as $ g $ is in the semigroup generated by $\\supp \\mu$ we deduce that $ \\limsup \\mathbb{P}(w_n \\in g ^{-1} S _{x,y}) > 0 $ as well. Hence $ \\limsup \\mathbb{P}(w_n \\in C _{G}(\\left(xg\\right)^2)) > 0$ so we see from Lemma \\ref{lemma:Linf-decay} that $ C _{G} \\left((xg) ^{2}\\right)  $ must have finite index. Since $ G $ is ICC, this implies $ (xg) ^{2} = e $. Letting $ I $ be the set of involutions, we see that $xS_{x,y} \\subset I$ so in particular $\\limsup \\mathbb{P}(w_n \\in I) > 0$. However, since $ G $ is ICC, it is in particular not virtually abelian, so by Theorem 5.1 of \\cite{amir2023probabilistic}, we have $ \\mathbb{P}(w_n \\in I) \\to 0 $, a contradiction."

Suppose $ \\mu $ is irreducible (resp. irreducible and symmetric). We first `thin' out the set of all $F$-switching (resp. superswitching) elements as follows. Let $( U _{x}) _{x \\in G} $ be a collection of i.i.d. Uniform$\\left([0,1]\\right)$ random variables, and let $ T $ be the subset of $ G $ consisting of all $ a $ that are $ F $-switching (resp. $F$-superswitching) and satisfy $ U_a \\geq U _{b} $ for all $ b \\in F^2aF^2$ (resp. $F^2a^{\\pm}F^2$). Almost surely the random variables are distinct, so the set $T$ (resp. $ T \\cup T ^{-1} $) is $ F $-switching. We let $ \\tau $ be the first hitting time of $T$ (resp. $ T \\cup T ^{-1} $), so it suffices to show that $ \\tau $ is almost surely finite. \n\n\tBy Lemma \\ref{lemma:RW-superswitching}, almost surely for every sample path of the $ \\mu $-random walk, $ w _{n} $ is $F$-switching infinitely often. If $ \\mu $ is irreducible and symmetric, it is non-degenerate, so $ w_n $ is $F$-superswitching infinitely often.

Then the sample path will almost surely intersect infinitely many distinct such subsets $ A _{1}, A _{2},... $ in elements $ a _{1}, a _{2}, ...$ . Since the random variables $ (U _{x} ) _{x \\in G} $ are independent of the random walk, then each $ a _{i} $ has probability at least $|F| ^{-4}/2 $ of being in the random set $ T $, independent of all other $ a _{j} $. Letting $ \\tau $ be the first hitting time of $T$ (resp. $ T \\cup T ^{-1} $), we see that $ \\tau $ is almost surely finite. \n\n\tWe observe that if $ \\mu $ is symmetric then, as $ T \\cup T ^{-1} $ is symmetric, the stopped measure $ \\mu _{\\tau} $ is clearly symmetric as well.
