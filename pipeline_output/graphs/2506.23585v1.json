Given $u$, $v \\in \\cal{B}(0)$, set $N$ to be the smallest positive integer such that $d(u,v)+c < N$.\n    Consider a path $\\ga$ from $u$ to $v$ in $\\cal{B}$ whose length is $d(u,v)$.  Pick $N$ distinct points $p_1, \\dots ,p_N $ on $\\ga$ with $p_1=u$ and $p_{N}=v$. Since the set of all chambers forms a partition of $\\cal{B}$, for each $p_i$, there exists $q_i \\in \\cal{B}(0)$ such that $p_i$ and $q_i$ are in the same chamber so that $d(p_i,q_i)<c$.\n    Then we have \n    $$\n    d(q_i,q_{i+1}) \\leq d(q_i,p_i)+d(p_i,p_{i+1})+d(p_{i+1},q_{i+1})\n    \\leq 2c + \\frac{d(u,v)}{N} \\leq 3c \n    $$\n    for every $i$. We remark that $c \\geq 1$ by setting the length of the edges (i.e., 1-simplices) to be 1 with respect to $d$.\n    Since $c$ is the diameter of the chambers,\n    for the vertices $q_i$ and $q_{i+1}$, there exist consecutively adjacent three chambers $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ (not necessarily distinct) such that $q_i \\in C_1$ and $q_{i+1} \\in C_3$.\n    This implies that $d_g(q_i,q_{i+1}) \\leq 3 $ \n    \n    and hence we obtain $d_g(u,v)\\leq 3(N-1)$ by taking $q_1=u$ and $q_{N}=v$.\n    By the minimality of $N$, $d_g(u,v) \\leq 3(d(u,v)+c)$, as desired."
