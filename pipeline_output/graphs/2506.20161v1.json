Let $\\gamma_g$ denote this geodesic ray. If $\\xi\\in \\pa G$ and $\\alpha$\nis a geodesic ray in $\\Gamma_G$ joining $1$ to $\\xi$ and $\\{g_n\\}$\nis a sequence of cyclically reduced elements then $g_n\\map \\xi$ if and only if\n$g^{\\infty}_n=\\gamma_{g_n}(\\infty)\\map \\xi$ as $n\\map \\infty$.\n\n\nThus we have $\\A\\sse V_m$. Now, let $\\alpha$ be a geodesic ray starting from $1$ and\nending at a point of $V_w$. Suppose $\\alpha(n_0)=w$. Now, for any $n\\in \\N$ we define\nbelow a reduced element $g_n$ of $[G,G]$ such that $wg_n$ is reduced and cyclically reduced.\nLet $\\iota: G\\map G$ be the automorphism of $G$ given by $\\iota (x_i)=x^{-1}_i$ for all\n$1\\leq i\\leq m$. We note that for all $g\\in G$, $g.\\iota(g)\\in [G,G]$.\n\nThere two cases to consider to define $g_n$'s.\n\n\n\n{\\bf Case 1.} Suppose $w$ starts and ends with nonzero powers of\nthe same element of $S$. Without loss of generality suppose $w$ starts\nand ends with some nonzero powers of $x_1$. Now, depending on $t=w^{-1}\\alpha(n_0+1)$\nthere are two subcases to consider.\n\n{\\bf Subcase 1.1.} Suppose $t=x_1$ or $t=x^{-1}_1$.\nNow, for all $k\\in \\N$ we look at the word $w_k=w^{-1}\\alpha(n_0+k)$.\nWe note that $w_k=x^{r_1}_{p_1}x^{r_2}_{p_2}\\ldots x^{r_i}_{p_i}$\nwhere  $1\\leq p_j\\leq m$, $p_1=1$ and $r_1, r_2,\\cdots, r_i$ are all nonzero integers.\nSuppose there is subsequence of natural numbers $\\{k_n\\}$\nsuch that  for all $n\\in \\N$, $w_{k_n}$ ends with a power of $x_2$. Then we define\n$g_n$ as follows: If $w_{k_n}=x^{r_1}_{1}x^{r_2}_{p_2}\\ldots x^{r_i}_{2}$ then we let\n$g_n=w_{k_n}.\\iota(w_{k_n})$. Then clearly $wg_n$ is reduced and cyclically reduced and\n$[1,wg_n]\\cap \\alpha$ contains $[1,ww_{k_n}]$ as a subsegment, whence $(wg_n)^{\\infty}\\in\\A$ and $(wg_n)^{\\infty}\\map\\al(\\infty)$ as $n\\map\\infty$.\n\nOn the other hand if for all but finitely many $w_k$'s end with a nonzero power of\n$x_1$ then we define  $g'_n=w_n.x_2.\\iota(w_n.x_2)$ for all $n\\in \\N$.\nWe note that clearly $\\{g_n\\}$ can be taken to be a suitable subsequence\nof $\\{g'_n\\}$.\n\n{\\bf Subcase 1.2.} Suppose $t$ is either $x_2$ or $x^{-1}_2$.\nWe define $w_k$'s as in Subcase 1.1 and look for a sequence of natural numbers\n$\\{k_n\\}$ such that $w_{k_n}$ ends with a power of $x_1$. If such a sequence\nexists then we define $g_n =w_{k_n}.t^{-1}.\\iota(w_{k_n}t^{-1})$.\n\nOn the other hand, if all but finitely many $w_k$'s end with $x_2$\nthen for all large $n$ we define\n$g_n=w_n.x_1.t^{-1}.\\iota(w_n.x_1.t^{-1})$.\n\n\n{\\bf Case 2.} Suppose $w$ starts and ends with the power of two different symbols.\nIn this case also the choices of $g_n$'s can be made in a similar manner.

      "proof": "{\\bf Step 1.} First we prove an analogue of Proposition \\ref{main prop}\nto get hold of a free quasiconvex subgroup whose commensurator in $G$\nhas a rather simple structure.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{step 1 of thm}\nIf $G$ is a nonelementary hyperbolic group and $H<G$ is a nonelementary quasiconvex\nsubgroup then there is subgroup $F$ of $H$ such that with the following properties.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $F\\isom \\mathbb F_n$ where $n\\geq 2$ and $F$ is quasiconvex in $G$.\n\\item $F$ is a (finite index) normal subgroup of $Comm_G(F)$.\n\\item $Comm_G(F)=\\mathbb F A \\isom \\mathbb F \\ltimes A$\nwhere $A$ is a finite normal subgroup of $Comm_G(F)$ and $\\mathbb F$\nis a free group containing $F$ as a finite index subgroup.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nThe proof idea is to construct a descending sequence of finitely generated\nfree groups $H\\supset F_1 \\supset F_2\\cdots $ such that we have better control\non $\\mathcal I_G(F_i)$ at each stage (see Section \\ref{sec-gen on mal} for the notation).\n\nAs $H$ is nonelementary, by Proposition \\ref{qc prop}(6), we can find a free subgroup\n$F_1$ of $H$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb F_2$ which is quasiconvex in $G$. Let $G_1= Comm_G(F_1)$.\nThen $F_1$ has finite index in $G_1$ by Proposition \\ref{qc prop}(4). Hence, we can\nfind a finite index subgroup  $F_2$ of $F_1$ which is normal in $G_1$.\nWe note that $Comm_G(F_1)=Comm_G(F_2)$ (Lemma \\ref{lemma: commensurator}). Thus $F_2$ is a finitely generated free\nquasiconvex of $G$ such that $F_2$ is normal in $Comm_G(F_2)$.\n\nBy Lemma \\ref{commen lemma}, for all $g\\in G\\setminus Comm_G(F_2)$, $F_2\\cap F^g_2$ has\ninfinite index in $F_2$. We recall that $F_2$ acts on the set\n$\\mathcal E'_G(F_2)=\\{E<F_2: E=F_2\\cap F^g_2,\\, g\\in \\mathcal I_G(F_2)\\setminus Comm_G(F_2)\\}$\nby conjugation (Lemma \\ref{lem-properties of I(H)}), and by Lemma \\ref{egh finite}, there are finitely many $F_2$-orbits of subgroups\nin $\\mathcal E'_G(F_2)$. Let $\\mathcal E\\subset \\mathcal E'_G(F_2)$ be a finite subset containing\nexactly one element from each of the $F_2$-orbits of infinite subgroups of the form $F_2\\cap F^g_2$, $g\\in G$.\nAs $Comm_G(F_2)=G_2$, say, is virtually free, by Proposition \\ref{main prop}, we may\nconstruct a subgroup $F_3<F_2$ with the following two properties:\\smallskip\n\n(1) $F_3\\cap E^h=\\{1\\}$ for all $E\\in \\mathcal E$ and for all $h\\in F_2$.\nWe note that this implies \n$Comm_G(F_3)=Comm_{G_2}(F_3)$. Indeed, let $x\\notin G_2$ such that $[F_3:F_3\\cap F^x_3]<\\infty$. In particular, $x\\in \\mathcal I_G(F_2)\\setminus Comm_{G}(F_2)$. Thus $F_3\\cap (F_2\\cap F^x_2)$ is infinite $-$ contradicting to the fact that $F_3\\cap E^h$ is trivial.\\smallskip\n\n(2) There is a free subgroup $\\mathbb F<Comm_G(F_3)$ and a finite normal\nsubgroup $A$ of $Comm_G(F_3)=\\mathbb F A\\isom \\mathbb F \\ltimes A$.\n\nFinally, we define $F=\\mathbb F\\cap F_3$. Clearly then $F$ satisfies the properties\nof the proposition.\n\\end{proof}\n\n{\\bf Step 2.} We continue to use the notations and definition from Proposition \\ref{step 1 of thm} and\nits proof; e.g. let $F$ still denote the subgroup of $G$ as constructed in Proposition\n\\ref{step 1 of thm}.  Next, we seek a subgroup of $F$ with the desired properties.\nThe proof runs, once again, along the lines of Proposition \\ref{step 1 of thm}.\n\nLet $G_3=Comm_G(F)$.\nOnce again, let $\\{E_1, \\ldots, E_l\\}$ be a finite set of representatives\nof infinite and infinite index subgroups of $F$ of the form $F\\cap F^g$ up to conjugation\nby elements of $F$, where\n$g\\in G\\setminus Comm_G(F)$. Then by Proposition \\ref{pingpong prop}, there is a\nfree subgroup $F_4$, say, in $F$ of rank two such that\n$F_4\\cap E^h_i$ is finite for all $h\\in F$ and $1\\leq i\\leq l$.\nWe note the inclusions $F_4<F<\\mathbb F<G_3$. If necessary, by passing to a further\nsubgroup we may assume that $A< Z_G(F_4)$. Now, using Theorem \\ref{malnormal in free},\none can find a subgroup of $F_4$ which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb F_2$ and which is\nmalnormal in $\\mathbb F$.\nLet $H_1$ be such a subgroup. Now it follows that $H_1$ satisfies the properties of\nTheorem \\ref{main malnormal thm}.\n\nIndeed, $H_1A\\isom H_1\\times A$ is weakly malnormal in $G_3$, and so $Comm_{G_3}(H_1)\\isom H_1\\times A$. It follows, as explained in $(1)$ above (in the proof of Proposition \\ref{step 1 of thm}), that $Comm_G(H_1)=Comm_{G_3}(H_1)=Comm_{G_3}(H_1A)\\isom H_1\\times A$. Finally, we have $(a)$ $H_1A\\cap E_i$ is finite for all $g\\in \\mathcal I_G(F)\\setminus G_3$, $(b)$ $H_1A$ has finite index in $Comm_{G_3}(H_1A)$, and $(c)$ $H_1A$ is weakly malnormal in $G_3$. It follows that $H_1A\\isom H_1\\times A$ is weakly malnormal in $G$."
