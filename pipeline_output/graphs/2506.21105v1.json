Consequently, according to \\autoref{LEM: Descend Zx regular}, $f'$ is $\\mu$-regular. However, $f'$ is already $\\lambda$-regular.

Thus, $\\mathrm{Tor}^{\\Z}_1 ( \\widehat{\\Z}, H_{\\ast-1}(G,\\mathcal{H};\\widehat{\\Z}))=0$, which implies the first isomorphism. \n\nMoving on to the second isomorphism, we first deal with the profinite side. For $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, let $\\Z/n! $ be the finite $\\widehat{G}$-module with trivial $\\widehat{G}$-action, and the quotient maps $\\Z/(n+1)! \\to \\Z/n! $ are also homomorphisms of $\\widehat{G}$-modules.

Let $C^n_\\bullet=F_\\bullet \\otimes_{\\Z[G]} \\Z/n!$. Then,  $C^0_\\bullet\\leftarrow C^1_\\bullet \\leftarrow C^2_\\bullet \\leftarrow \\cdots$ is a tower of chain complexes of abelian groups. \n\nNote that $\\Z/(n+1)!\\to \\Z/n!$ is surjective and the tensor product $F_k\\otimes_{\\Z[G]} -$ is right exact, so $C^{n+1}_k \\to C^n_k$ is surjective for any $n,k\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Consequently, the tower  $C^0_\\bullet\\leftarrow C^1_\\bullet  \\leftarrow \\cdots$ satisfies degree-wise the Mittag-Leffler condition. Then, according to \\cite[Theorem 3.5.8]{Wei94}, there is a short exact sequence \n$$\n0\\to {\\limi\\limits_n}^1 H_{\\ast+1} (C^n_{\\bullet})\\to H_\\ast (\\limi\\limits_n C^n_\\bullet) \\to \\limi\\limits_n H_\\ast (C^n_\\bullet)\\to 0.\n$$\n\n\nBy construction $H_\\ast (C^n_\\bullet)= \\mathrm{Tor}_{\\ast}^G(\\Delta^\\perp_{G,\\mathcal{H}}, \\Z/n!)= H_{\\ast+1}(G,\\mathcal{H};\\Z/n!)$. Note that $C^n_k\\cong (\\Z/n!)^{\\oplus r_k}$, where $F_k= \\Z[G]^{\\oplus r_k}$. Thus, $\\limi_n C^n_k\\cong \\widehat{\\Z}^{\\oplus r_k}\\cong F_k\\otimes_{\\Z[G]} \\widehat{\\Z}$, and $H_\\ast(\\limi_n C^n_\\bullet)\\cong H_\\ast(F_\\bullet \\otimes_{\\Z[G]} \\widehat{\\Z})=\\mathrm{Tor}_\\ast^G(\\Delta^\\perp_{G,\\mathcal{H}}, \\widehat{\\Z})= H_{\\ast+1}(G,\\mathcal{H};\\widehat{\\Z})$. Thus, we actually have a short exact sequence\n$$\n0\\to {\\limi\\limits_n}^1 H_{\\ast} (C^n_{\\bullet})\\to H_{\\ast}(G,\\mathcal{H};\\widehat{\\Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\;\\phi\\;} \\limi\\limits_n H_{\\ast}(G,\\mathcal{H};\\Z/n!)\\to 0.\n$$\nThe map $\\phi$ is exactly the one in (\\ref{tensor hatZ equ1}), since it is induced by the maps between the coefficient modules $\\widehat{\\Z}\\to \\Z/n!$.\n\nNote that for each $n,k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, $C^n_k\\cong (\\Z/n!)^{\\oplus r_k}$ is finite, so $H_k(C^n_\\bullet)$ is also finite. As a consequence, the tower of abelian groups $H_k(C^n_\\bullet)$ satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, and $\\limi^1_n H_k (C^n_\\bullet)=0$ according to \\cite[Proposition 3.5.7]{Wei94}. Therefore, the map $\\phi$ is indeed an isomorphism. \n\n\nWe can now relate the two sides. \nSince $(G,\\mathcal{H})$ is cohomologically good and of type $\\text{FP}_\\infty$, \\autoref{PROP: homology good} implies that for $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, the map $\\iota_\\ast: H_\\ast(G,\\mathcal{H};\\Z/n!) \\to \\H_\\ast (\\widehat{G},\\overline{\\mathcal{H}};\\Z/n!)$ is an  isomorphism. In addition, these isomorphisms are natural with respect to the coefficient modules $\\Z/n!$. Thus, we have a commutative diagram of abelian groups\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{tikzcd}\n{H_\\ast(G,\\mathcal{H};\\widehat{\\Z})} \\arrow[d, \"\\cong\"',\"\\phi\"] \\arrow[r, \"\\iota_\\ast\"] & {\\H_\\ast(\\widehat{G},\\overline{\\mathcal{H}};\\widehat{\\Z})} \\arrow[d, \"\\cong\"] \\\\\n{\\limi\\limits_n H_\\ast(G,\\mathcal{H};\\Z/n!)} \\arrow[r, \"\\cong\"',\"\\iota_\\ast\"]                  & {\\limi\\limits_n \\H_\\ast(\\widehat{G},\\overline{\\mathcal{H}};\\Z/n!)}           \n\\end{tikzcd}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere the two vertical maps and the bottom map are all proven to be isomorphisms. Thus, $\\iota_\\ast: {H_\\ast(G,\\mathcal{H};\\widehat{\\Z})} \\to  {\\H_\\ast(\\widehat{G},\\overline{\\mathcal{H}};\\widehat{\\Z})}$  is also an isomorphism (of abelian groups). Note that $\\iota_\\ast$ is obviously a homomorphism of $\\widehat{\\Z}$-modules, so the proof completes."

      "proof": "We divide the proof into three cases.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1:} $M$ is closed, and then $\\Sigma$ is also closed. \n\nA sufficient condition for $\\pi_1M$ to induce the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1\\Sigma$ is that any finite-index subgroup of $\\pi_1\\Sigma$ is separable in $\\pi_1M$, since this will imply that any closed subset in $\\pi_1\\Sigma$ under its profinite topology is closed under the subspace topology of $\\pi_1\\Sigma$ inherited from the profinite topology of $\\pi_1 M$. In other words,  for any finite cover $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}$ of $\\Sigma$, there is a $\\pi_1$-injective immersion $f:\\widetilde{\\Sigma}\\to \\Sigma \\hookrightarrow M$, and it suffices to show that $f_\\ast(\\pi_1\\widetilde{\\Sigma})$ is separable in $\\pi_1M$. \n\nThe criteria for separability is established by Przytycki--Wise \\cite{PW14}. \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{PW14} showed that given a $\\pi_1$-injective immersed closed surface $f: S\\looparrowright M$, $f_\\ast(\\pi_1S)$ is separable in $\\pi_1M$ if $f$  lifts to an embedding in a finite cover $M'$ of $M$. \nLiu \\cite{Liu16} provides a  characterization for virtual embedding. In fact, for an essentially immersed closed surface $f: S\\looparrowright M$, he \ndefined a spirality character $s(f)\\in H^1(\\Phi(S);\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times})$, in which $\\Phi(S)$ denotes the almost fiber part of $S$. \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{Liu16} showed that $S$ virtually embeds if and only if $s(f):H_1(\\Phi(S);\\Z)\\to \\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ takes value in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, for which Liu called that $S$ is aspiral in the almost fiber part. In our case, if we denote $\\iota:\\Sigma\\to M$ as the embedding, then $s(\\iota)$ takes value in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n\nMoreover, \\cite[Proposition 4.1]{Liu16} showed that the spirality character is natural. To be concrete, for a finite cover $\\kappa:\\widetilde{\\Sigma}\\to \\Sigma$, the spirality character of the immersion $f:\\widetilde{\\Sigma}\\xrightarrow{\\kappa}\\Sigma\\xrightarrow{\\iota} M$ satisfies $s(f)=\\kappa^\\ast s(\\iota)$. In other words, we have $$s(f): H_1(\\Phi(\\widetilde{\\Sigma});\\Z)\\xrightarrow{\\;\\kappa_\\ast\\;} H_1(\\Phi(\\Sigma);\\Z)\\xrightarrow{\\;s(\\iota)\\;} \\mathbb{Q}^\\times.$$ Therefore, $s(f)$ also takes value in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$. Consequently, $f$ lifts to an embedding in a finite cover of $M$ according to \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{Liu16}, and $f_\\ast(\\pi_1\\widetilde{\\Sigma})$ is separable according to the criteria of Przytycki--Wise \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{PW14}.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2:} $M$ has non-empty boundary, while $\\Sigma$ is closed. \n\nLet $D(M)$ be the double of $M$ along its boundary, which is a closed 3-manifold. Then the retraction $D(M)\\to M$ implies that $\\pi_1M$ injects into $\\pi_1D(M)$ through the inclusion map. Thus, $\\Sigma$ is an essentially embedded surface in $D(M)$. Since $M$ is aspherical and boundary-incompressible, $D(M)$ is also aspherical. Thus, by \\textbf{Case 1}, the profinite topology on $\\pi_1D(M)$ induces the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1\\Sigma$. Note that $\\pi_1\\Sigma <\\pi_1M< \\pi_1D(M)$, so the profinite topology on $\\pi_1M$ also induces the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1\\Sigma$, since the profinite topology on the subgroup $\\pi_1M$ is always finer than the subspace topology inherited from the profinite topology of $\\pi_1D(M)$. \n\n\\textbf{Case 3:} $M$ has non-empty boundary, and $\\Sigma$ also has non-empty boundary. \n\nLet $D(\\Sigma)$ be the double of $\\Sigma$ along its boundary, which embeds into $D(M)$. Since $\\Sigma$ is incompressible and boundary-incompressible, the double $D(\\Sigma)$ is incompressible in $D(M)$. According to \\textbf{Case 1}, $\\pi_1D(M)$ induces the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1D(\\Sigma)$. There is a retraction map $r: \\pi_1D(\\Sigma)\\to \\pi_1\\Sigma$ induced by the folding, that is, $r|_{\\pi_1\\Sigma}=id$. For any finite-index subgroup $H<\\pi_1\\Sigma$, $r^{-1}(H)$ is a finite-index subgroup in $\\pi_1D(\\Sigma)$ satisfying $r^{-1}(H)\\cap \\pi_1\\Sigma=H$. Thus, the profinite topology on $\\pi_1D(\\Sigma)$ induces the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1\\Sigma$. Combining these two steps, the profinite topology on $\\pi_1D(M)$ induces the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1\\Sigma$. Then, by the same reasoning as \\textbf{Case 2}, the profinite topology on $\\pi_1M$ induces the full profinite topology on $\\pi_1\\Sigma$."

      "proof": "\\iffalse\nWe view $M$ as a submanifold of $M_{\\mathbf{c}}$ whose complement is a disjoint union of solid tori. Let $M^\\star$ be the preimage of $M$ in the covering map $M_{\\c}'\\to M_{\\c} $. The  complement of $M^\\star$ in $M_{\\mathbf{c}}' $  is also a disjoint union of solid tori, which are exactly the preimages of the solid tori in $M_{\\mathbf{c}}$. Thus, $M^\\star$ is a connected finite cover of $M$, and $M_{\\c}'$ is also a Dehn filling of $M^\\star$. Group theoretically,  let $p: \\pi_1M\\to \\pi_1M_{\\c}$ denote the epimorphism induced by inclusion, and then $M^\\star$ is the finite cover corresponding to the finite-index subgroup $p^{-1}(\\pi_1M_{\\c}')$.\n\\fi\nAs before, we denote $p: \\pi_1M\\to \\pi_1M_{\\c}$ and $q:\\pi_1N\\to \\pi_1N_{\\Psi(\\c)}$ as the surjective homomorphisms induced by inclusions. Let $M^\\star$ be the finite cover of $M$ corresponding to the finite-index subgroup $p^{-1}(\\pi_1M_{\\c}')\\le \\pi_1M$, and let $N^\\star$ be the finite cover of $N$ corresponding to the finite-index subgroup $q^{-1}(\\pi_1N_{\\Psi(\\c)}')\\le \\pi_1N$. Then the commutative diagram (\\ref{dehnfillingequ}) implies that $f(\\widehat{\\pi_1M^\\star})=\\widehat{\\pi_1N^\\star}$, that is, $M^\\star$ and $N^\\star$ is an $f$--corresponding finite cover of $M$ and $N$.  We denote $f^\\star= f|_{\\widehat{\\pi_1M^\\star}} : \\widehat{\\pi_1M^\\star}\\to \\widehat{\\pi_1N^\\star}$. \n\nThe boundary slope $\\c\\in \\slp(\\partial M)$ lifts to its pre-image $\\c^{\\star}\\in \\slp(\\partial M^\\star)$, and similarly, $\\Psi(\\c)$ lifts to its pre-image $\\Psi(\\c)^\\star \\in \\slp(\\partial N^\\star)$.

Then   \n\\fi\n\n\\cite[Theorem 4.5]{Xu24b} proved that, assuming $f$ is peripheral $\\lambda$-regular, there exists $g\\in \\widehat{\\pi_1(X(K))}$ such that $f(m_J)=g^{-1} \\cdot (m_K)^{\\pm \\lambda}\\cdot g$ and  $f(l_J)=g^{-1} \\cdot (l_K)^{\\pm \\lambda}\\cdot g$. In fact, the proof there was based on the construction of \\autoref{THM: Dehn filling}, and it was shown that both  the meridian and the longitude can be distinguished among all boundary slopes by the profinite isomorphism type of their corresponding Dehn surgeries. Now we have proven that $f$ is peripheral regular, according to \\autoref{mainthm: regular} for the case of hyperbolic knots or \\autoref{PROP: mixed peripheral regular} for the case of hyperbolic-type satellite knots. Thus, one takes $\\lambda=1$ in the previous conclusion  and derive that $f(m_J)=g^{-1} \\cdot (m_K)^{\\pm 1}\\cdot g$ and  $f(l_J)=g^{-1} \\cdot (l_K)^{\\pm 1}\\cdot g$."

Therefore, ${\\phi_i}$ and ${\\psi_i^\\ast \\theta_i}$ are equivalent.\n\nNext, we prove the two extra properties. First, we show that if the presentation $\\phi$ in this construction is abelian, then $\\theta$ is also abelian. \nIn this case, $[\\pi_1M,\\pi_1M]\\subseteq \\ker(\\phi)$; since $\\Phi$ is continuous, we have $\\overline{[\\pi_1M,\\pi_1M]}\\subseteq \\ker(\\Phi)$. \nAccording to \\cite[Lemma 2.8]{Xu24a}, $\\overline{[\\pi_1M,\\pi_1M]}=\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_1M},\\widehat{\\pi_1M}]}$. \nSince $f$ is an isomorphism of profinite groups, $f(\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_1M},\\widehat{\\pi_1M}]})= \\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_1N},\\widehat{\\pi_1N}]}$. \nTherefore, $\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_1N},\\widehat{\\pi_1N}]}\\subseteq \\ker(\\Phi\\circ f^{-1})=\\ker(\\Theta)$. Since $[\\pi_1N,\\pi_1N]\\subseteq \\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_1N},\\widehat{\\pi_1N}]}$, we finally derive that $[\\pi_1N,\\pi_1N]\\subseteq \\ker(\\theta)$, which is to say  that $\\theta$ is also abelian. \n\nSecond, we show that if the presentation $\\phi$ in this construction is reducible, then $\\theta$ is also reducible. In this case, $\\Phi(\\pi_1M)$ keeps invariant a non-trivial linear subspace  $W\\subsetneq \\overline{\\Q_p}^n$. Since $\\pi_1M$ is dense in $\\widehat{\\pi_1M}$ and $\\Phi$ is continuous, $\\Phi(\\widehat{\\pi_1M})$ actually keeps $W$ invariant. Note that $\\Phi(\\widehat{\\pi_1M})=\\Theta(\\widehat{\\pi_1N})$, so $\\Theta(\\widehat{\\pi_1N})$ also keeps $W$ invariant. Consequently, $\\theta(\\pi_1N)$ keeps the non-trivial linear subspace $\\varsigma(W)\\subsetneq \\C^n$ invariant, which is to say $\\theta$ is also reducible."

For simplicity of notation in this paragraph, we abbreviate $\\pi_1(X(J))$ into $\\pi_J$ and $\\pi_1(X(K))$ into $\\pi_K$. Suppose by contrary that $\\rho$ is abelian; since $\\varsigma$ is injective, we have $[\\pi_J,\\pi_J]\\subseteq\\ker(\\phi)$. Since $\\Phi$ is continuous, $\\overline{[\\pi_J,\\pi_J]}\\subseteq \\ker(\\Phi)$. According to \\cite[Lemma 2.8]{Xu24a}, $\\overline{[\\pi_J,\\pi_J]}=\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_J},\\widehat{\\pi_J}]}$, and since $f$ is an isomorphism of profinite groups, $f (\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_J},\\widehat{\\pi_J}]})= \\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_K},\\widehat{\\pi_K}]}$. Then, by the commutative diagram, $\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_K},\\widehat{\\pi_K}]} \\subseteq \\ker(\\Theta)$. Note that $[\\pi_K,\\pi_K]\\subseteq \\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_K},\\widehat{\\pi_K}]}$. Thus, $[\\pi_K,\\pi_K]\\subseteq \\ker(\\tau)$. Therefore, we derive that $\\tau$ is an abelian representation, which is contradictory with our assumption. Hence, we have proven that  $\\rho$ is non-abelian.\n\nMoreover, by construction, \n$$\n\\rho(m_J)=\\varsigma(\\Theta(f (m_J)))=\\tau(m_K)= \\begin{pmatrix} M & 0 \\\\ 0 & M^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$ \\rho(l_J)=\\varsigma(\\Theta(f (l_J)))=\\tau(l_J)=\\begin{pmatrix} L & 0 \\\\ 0 & L^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\\iffalse\nThen, by construction, \n$$\n\\theta(m_K)= \\Theta(m_K)=\\Phi(f^{-1}(m_K))=\\Phi(m_J)=\\begin{pmatrix} M & a \\\\ 0 & M^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\theta(l_K)= \\Theta(l_K)=\\Phi(f^{-1}(l_K))=\\Phi(l_J)=\\begin{pmatrix} L & b \\\\ 0 & L^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\\fi\n\\fi\n\n\nBy symmetry, replacing $f$ with $f^{-1}$ also implies $\\xi^\\ast (J)\\subseteq\\xi^\\ast(K)$.

For simplicity of notation in this paragraph, we abbreviate $\\pi_1(X(J))$ into $\\pi_J$ and $\\pi_1(X(K))$ into $\\pi_K$. Suppose by contrary that $\\tau$ is abelian, since $\\varsigma$ is injective, we have $[\\pi_K,\\pi_K]\\subseteq\\ker(\\theta)$. Since $\\Theta$ is continuous, $\\overline{[\\pi_K,\\pi_K]}\\subseteq \\ker(\\Theta)$. According to \\cite[Lemma 2.8]{Xu24a}, $\\overline{[\\pi_K,\\pi_K]}=\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_K},\\widehat{\\pi_K}]}$. Since $f$ is an isomorphism of profinite groups, $f^{-1}(\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_K},\\widehat{\\pi_K}]})= \\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_J},\\widehat{\\pi_J}]}$. Then, by the commutative diagram, $\\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_J},\\widehat{\\pi_J}]} \\subseteq \\ker(\\Phi)$. Note that $[\\pi_J,\\pi_J]\\subseteq \\overline{[\\widehat{\\pi_J},\\widehat{\\pi_J}]}$. Thus, $[\\pi_J,\\pi_J]\\subseteq \\ker(\\phi)$, and further, $[\\pi_J,\\pi_J]\\subseteq \\ker(\\rho)$. Therefore, we derive that $\\rho$ is an abelian representation, which is contradictory with our assumption. Hence, we have proven that  $\\tau$ is non-abelian.\n\nMoreover, by construction, \n$$\n\\tau(m_K)=\\varsigma(\\Phi(f^{-1} (m_K)))=\\rho(m_J)= \\begin{pmatrix} M & a \\\\ 0 & M^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$ \\tau(l_K)=\\varsigma(\\Phi(f^{-1} (l_K)))=\\rho(l_J)=\\begin{pmatrix} L & b \\\\ 0 & L^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\\iffalse\nThen, by construction, \n$$\n\\theta(m_K)= \\Theta(m_K)=\\Phi(f^{-1}(m_K))=\\Phi(m_J)=\\begin{pmatrix} M & a \\\\ 0 & M^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\theta(l_K)= \\Theta(l_K)=\\Phi(f^{-1}(l_K))=\\Phi(l_J)=\\begin{pmatrix} L & b \\\\ 0 & L^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\\fi\nThus, by \\autoref{DEF: A-polynomial}, $(M,L)\\in \\xi^\\ast (K)$, so $\\xi^\\ast (J)\\subseteq \\xi^\\ast(K)$. By symmetry, replacing $f$ with $f^{-1}$ implies $\\xi^\\ast (K)\\subseteq\\xi^\\ast(J)$. Thus, $\\xi^\\ast(K)=\\xi^\\ast (J)$ which finishes the proof. \n\\fi"

      "proof": "As in \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}, we may also assume that $J$ and $K$ are non-trivial knots. \nAccording to \\autoref{THM: JSJ} and \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem2}), which does not rely on the peripheral structure, $J$ and $K$ belong  to the same class of torus knots, graph knots, hyperbolic knots, or satellite knots with hyperbolic pieces. When they are torus knots, again by \\cite{BF19}, $J$ and $K$ are equivalent; and when they are graph knots, Wilkes \\cite[Theorem B]{WilkesKnot} proved that $J$ and $K$ are equivalent whenever one of them is prime. Thus, in these two cases, obviously $\\widetilde A_J\\doteq \\widetilde A_K$ up to a possible mirror image. When $J$ and $K$ are hyperbolic knots, it follows from \\autoref{PROP: respect peripheral structure} that any isomorphism  $\\widehat{\\pi_1(X(J))}\\cong \\widehat{\\pi_1(X(K))}$ respects the peripheral structure. Hence, the conclusion for this case follows from \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}.\n\nIn what follows, we assume that $J$ and $K$ are satellite knots with hyperbolic pieces. \nFor simplicity of notation, let $M=X(J)$ and $N=X(K)$. The JSJ-graphs $\\Gamma^M$ and $\\Gamma^N$ are rooted trees, where the roots $r\\in \\Gamma^M$ and $s\\in \\Gamma^N$ correspond to the outermost JSJ-pieces. Let $f:\\widehat{\\pi_1M}\\to \\widehat{\\pi_1N}$ be an isomorphism, and let $f_\\bullet: (\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}^M},\\Gamma^M)\\xrightarrow{\\cong}(\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}^N},\\Gamma^N)$ be the congruent isomorphism given by \\autoref{THM: JSJ}. Then by \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem1}), $\\F(r)=s$. In particular, $M_r$ and $N_s$ are either both hyperbolic or both Seifert fibered by (\\ref{lem2}) of the same lemma.  \n\nWhen $M_r$ and $N_s$ are hyperbolic, it follows from \\cite[Proposition 3.3]{Xu24b} that $f$ respects the peripheral structure. This can also be deduced from \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem4}). Thus, in this case, the conclusion follows from \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}.\n\nNow we assume that $M_r$ and $N_s$ are Seifert fibered. Then, according to \\cite[Theorem 4.18]{Bud06}, the outermost Seifert fibered piece of a satellite knot can only be a cable  space $C_{p,q}=(S_{0,2}; p/q)$ ($\\abs{q}\\ge 2$) or a composite space $S_{0,n}\\times S^1$ ($n\\ge 3$), where \\iffalse$S_{0,2}$ denotes the annulus, and\\fi $S_{0,n}$ denotes $S^2$ removing $n$ open disks. Note that when the outermost piece is a cable space, the degree of the root in the JSJ-graph is $1$, and when  the outermost piece is a composite space, the degree of the root in the JSJ-graph is greater than $1$. Thus, the graph isomorphism $\\F:\\Gamma^M\\to \\Gamma^N$ implies that $M_r$ and $N_s$ are either both cable spaces or both composite spaces. When they are both composite spaces, both $J$ and $K$ are non-prime. Thus, by assumption, $M_r=C_{p,q}$ and $N_s=C_{p',q'}$ are cable spaces.\n\nConsequently, $J$ is the $(p,q)$-cable of the companion knot $c(J)$, and $K$ is the $(p',q')$-cable of the companion knot $c(K)$. We may assume with out loss of generality that $q>0$ and $q'>0$.  By assumption, $c(J)$ and $c(K)$ are hyperbolic knots or satellite knots containing hyperbolic pieces. Let $M^0=M-M_r$ which is the exterior of $c(J)$, and let $N^0=N-N_s$ which is the exterior of $c(K)$. The congruent isomorphism $f_\\bullet$ restricts to a congruent isomorphism $f_\\bullet^0:(\\widehat{{\\mathcal{G}}^{M^0}},\\Gamma^M-r)\\to (\\widehat{{\\mathcal{G}}^{N^0}},\\Gamma^N-s)$. Then $f_\\bullet^0$ also induces an isomorphism $f^0:\\widehat{\\pi_1M^0}\\to \\widehat{\\pi_1N^0}$ according to \\cite[Proposition 3.11]{Xu24a}.  For any $v\\in V(\\Gamma^M-r)$,  $f_v^0=f_v$ respects the peripheral structure, as is completely witnessed in the JSJ-graph. Thus, by \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem4}), $f^0$ respects the peripheral structure. Then, by \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}, up to a possible mirror image, $\\widetilde A_{c(J)}\\doteq \\widetilde A_{c(K)}$.\n\nLet us be precise about the possible mirror image. \nSince $M^0$ and $N^0$ are either hyperbolic or mixed, by \\autoref{mainthm: regular} and \\autoref{THM: Mixed peripheral} respectively, $f^0$ is peripheral regular. $\\partial M^0$ is endowed with  a preferred meridian-longitude basis $(m_{c(J)}, l_{c(J)})$, and $\\partial N^0$ is endowed with  a preferred meridian-longitude basis $(m_{c(K)}, l_{c(K)})$. According to \\autoref{THM: knot boundary}, there exists $g\\in \\widehat{\\pi_1(N^0)}$ such that $f^0(m_{c(J)})=g^{-1}  (m_{c(K)})^{\\pm 1}  g$ and $f^0(l_{c(J)})=g^{-1}  (l_{c(K)})^{\\pm 1}  g $. Up to possibly  reversing the orientation of the  orientation of the ambient space $S^3$, and possibly reversing the orientation of the knot $K$ along with its companion knot $c(K)$, we may assume $f^0(m_{c(J)})=g^{-1}   m_{c(K)}  g$ and $f^0(l_{c(J)})=g^{-1}   l_{c(K)}  g $. In this case, as shown in the proof of  \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}, $\\widetilde A_{c(J)}\\doteq \\widetilde A_{c(K)}$. \n\nWe follow this adjusted orientation. Then the cabling parameters $(p,q)$ and $(p',q')$ can be determined as follows. For the knot $J$, the cabling parameter is $(p,q)$ if and only if the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p,q}=M_r$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (pm_{c(J)}+ql_{c(J)})$ at the JSJ-torus $\\partial M^0$. Similarly, the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p',q'}=N_s$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (p'm_{c(K)}+q'l_{c(K)})$ at the JSJ-torus $\\partial N^0$. Denote $\\partial f^0 = C_g\\circ f|_{\\overline{\\pi_1\\partial M^0}}$. In fact, $\\partial f^0$ does not depend on the choice of the element $g$ that induces the conjugation, according to \\cite[Proposition 6.7]{Xu24a}. Then the coherence relation (\\ref{butterfly}) implies a commutative diagram\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\usebox{\\gluecableequ}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are gluing maps at the JSJ-tori. It is shown in \\cite[Theorem 5.5]{Wil17} that $f_r$ preserves the closure of the fiber subgroup. Indeed, let $h_M\\in \\pi_1\\partial_0 M_r\\subseteq \\pi_1M_r$ and $h_N\\in \\pi_1\\partial_0 N_s\\subseteq \\pi_1N_s$ represent the regular fibers. If we write these peripheral subgroups in the addditive convention of $\\widehat{\\Z}$-modules, then $\\partial f_r^0(h_M)= \\lambda\\cdot h_N$ for some $\\lambda\\in \\Zx$. Note that $$\\partial f^0(\\widehat{\\varphi}(h_M))=\\partial f^0(\\pm (pm_{c(J)}+ql_{c(J)}))= \\pm (pm_{c(K)}+ql_{c(K)}),$$ while $$\\widehat{\\psi}(\\partial f^0_r( h_M))= \\widehat{\\psi}(\\lambda h_N )=\\pm \\lambda(p'm_{c(K)}+q'l_{c(K)}).$$ Thus, it follows from \\autoref{LEM: Zx+-1} that $\\lambda=\\pm1$ and $(p,q)=\\pm (p',q')$. As we have assumed $q,q'>0$, we finally obtain that $(p,q)=(p',q')$.\n\nThus, by the cabling formula \\autoref{THM: cable formula}, $\\widetilde A_{c(J)}\\doteq \\widetilde  A_{c(K)}$ and $(p,q)=(p',q')$ implies that $\\widetilde A_{J}\\doteq \\widetilde A_{K}$. \n\n\\iffalse\n\n\n\n\nThen the JSJ-torus $\\partial M^0$ is endowed with  a preferred meridian-longitude basis $(m_{c(J)}, l_{c(J)})$, and the cabling parameter is $(p,q)$ if and only if the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p,q}=M_r$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (pm_{c(J)}+ql_{c(J)})$. Similarly,     the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p',q'}=N_s$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (p'm_{c(K)}+q'l_{c(K)})$.\\fi"

In fact, the proof there was based on the construction of \\autoref{THM: Dehn filling}, and it was shown that both  the meridian and the longitude can be distinguished among all boundary slopes by the profinite isomorphism type of their corresponding Dehn surgeries. Now we have proven that $f$ is peripheral regular, according to \\autoref{mainthm: regular} for the case of hyperbolic knots or \\autoref{PROP: mixed peripheral regular} for the case of hyperbolic-type satellite knots.

Let $f_{\\bullet}:(\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}^M},\\Gamma^M)\\to (\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}^N},\\Gamma^N)$ be the congruent isomomrphism induced by $f$ given in \\autoref{THM: JSJ}. Then by \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem4}), each $f_v$ respects the peripheral structure. In fact, the JSJ-graphs $\\Gamma^M$ and $\\Gamma^N$ are rooted trees whose roots correspond to the outermost JSJ-piece, i.e. the pieces containing the boundary component of $M$ and $N$. In the proof of \\cite[Theorem 4.1]{WilkesKnot}, Wilkes showed that if $v\\in \\Gamma^M$ is a leaf which is not the root, then $f_v$ has scale type $(\\pm\\lambda,\\pm\\lambda)$. In fact, this follows from the classification of profinite isomorphisms between graph manifolds \\cite{Wil18} and the fact that the piece $M_v$ has non-zero `total slope' \\cite[Lemma 4.2]{WilkesKnot}. Since $\\Gamma^M$ is connected, by repeatedly applying \\autoref{LEM: gluing Seifert}~(\\ref{sl1}), we derive that $f_u$ has scale type $(\\pm\\lambda,\\pm\\lambda)$ for all $u\\in V(\\Gamma^M)$. In particular, let $u$ be the root. \\autoref{LEM: gluing Seifert}~(\\ref{sl2}) implies that $f_u$ is peripheral $\\lambda$-regular at all its boundary components obtained from JSJ-tori, so \\autoref{LEM: Seifert last one} implies that $f_u$ is also peripheral $\\lambda$-regular at the remaining boundary component $\\partial M$. The commutative diagram (\\ref{congruentdiag1}) then implies that \n$f$ is peripheral $\\lambda$-regular. Then, by \\cite[Theorem 9.11]{Xu24a}, $M=X(J)$ and $N=X(K)$ are homeomorphic. It then follows from \\cite{GL89} that $J$ and $K$ are equivalent."

It suffices to show that there exists a representation $\\phi: \\pi_1M\\to \\SL(n,\\C)$, such that $\\phi_i$ is equivalent (up to conjugation in $\\SL(n,\\C)$) to $\\psi_i^\\ast \\theta_i$  for each $1\\le i \\le k$, where  $\\phi_i$ is the restriction of $\\phi$ on the subgroup $\\pi_1\\partial_iM$.  \n\nAccording to  \\autoref{LEM: extend}, $\\theta$ extends to a (not necessarily continuous) representation $\\Theta: \\widehat{\\pi_1N}\\to \\SL(n,\\C)$. Let $\\Phi=\\Theta\\circ f: \\widehat{\\pi_1M}\\to \\SL(n,\\C)$, and let $\\phi:\\pi_1M\\to \\SL(n,\\C)$ be the restriction of $\\Phi$ on the subgroup $\\pi_1M$, as shown by the following commutative diagram. \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=0.6cm, row sep=0.4cm]\n\\pi_1M \\arrow[rdd, \"\\iffalse\\iota_J\\fi\"', hook] \\arrow[rrrrrrddd, \"\\phi\"]    &                                                                   &  &  &  &  &             \\\\\n                                                                       &                                                                   &  &  &  &  &             \\\\\n                                                                       & \\widehat{\\pi_1M} \\arrow[dd, \"f\"',\"\\cong\"] \\arrow[rrrrrd, \"\\Phi=\\Theta\\circ f\"']    &  &  &  &  &             \\\\\n                                                                       &                                                                   &  &  &  &  & {\\SL(2,\\C)} \\\\\n                                                                       & \\widehat{\\pi_1N} \\arrow[rrrrru, \"\\Theta \"] &  &  &  &  &             \\\\\n                                                                       &                                                                   &  &  &  &  &             \\\\\n\\pi_1N \\arrow[ruu, \"\\iffalse\\iota_K\\fi\", hook] \\arrow[rrrrrruuu, \"\\theta\"'] &                                                                   &  &  &  &  &            \n\\end{tikzcd}\n\\end{equation*}\n\n\n\nThen, for any $\\alpha \\in \\pi_1\\partial_iM$, \n$$\\phi_{i}(\\alpha)=\\Theta(f(\\alpha))=\\Theta(g_i ^{-1}\\psi_i(\\alpha)g_i)= \\Theta(g_i)  ^{-1} \\theta(\\psi_i(\\alpha))   \\Theta(g_i)= \\Theta(g_i)^{-1}\\cdot (\\psi_i^{\\ast}\\theta_i) (\\alpha)  \\cdot \\Theta(g_i).$$ \nNote that the element $\\Theta(g_i)\\in \\SL(n,\\C)$ that induces the conjugation is irrelavent with $\\alpha$. Therefore, ${\\phi_i}$ and ${\\psi_i^\\ast \\theta_i}$ are equivalent, which proves $ \\Psi^\\ast(\\mathrm{im}(\\mathscr{X}_n(N)\\to \\mathscr{X}_n(\\partial N))) \\subseteq \\mathrm{im}(\\mathscr{X}_n(M)\\to \\mathscr{X}_n(\\partial M)) $.\n\nBy symmetry, we consider $f^{-1}:\\widehat{\\pi_1N}\\to \\widehat{\\pi_1M}$. Let $h_i=f^{-1}(g_i^{-1})\\in\\widehat{\\pi_1M}$. Then $f^{-1}(\\overline{\\pi_1\\partial_i N})= {\\overline{\\pi_1\\partial_iM}}^{h_i}$, and $C_{h_i}\\circ f^{-1}|_{\\overline{\\pi_1\\partial_iN}}$ is the profinite completion of $\\psi_i^{-1}$.

      "proof": "As in \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}, we may also assume that $J$ and $K$ are non-trivial knots. \nAccording to \\autoref{THM: JSJ} and \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem2}), which does not rely on the peripheral structure, $J$ and $K$ belong  to the same class of torus knots, graph knots, hyperbolic knots, or satellite knots with hyperbolic pieces. When they are torus knots, again by \\cite{BF19}, $J$ and $K$ are equivalent; and when they are graph knots, Wilkes \\cite[Theorem B]{WilkesKnot} proved that $J$ and $K$ are equivalent whenever one of them is prime. Thus, in these two cases, obviously $\\widetilde A_J\\doteq \\widetilde A_K$ up to a possible mirror image. When $J$ and $K$ are hyperbolic knots, it follows from \\autoref{PROP: respect peripheral structure} that any isomorphism  $\\widehat{\\pi_1(X(J))}\\cong \\widehat{\\pi_1(X(K))}$ respects the peripheral structure. Hence, the conclusion for this case follows from \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}.\n\nIn what follows, we assume that $J$ and $K$ are satellite knots with hyperbolic pieces. \nFor simplicity of notation, let $M=X(J)$ and $N=X(K)$. The JSJ-graphs $\\Gamma^M$ and $\\Gamma^N$ are rooted trees, where the roots $r\\in \\Gamma^M$ and $s\\in \\Gamma^N$ correspond to the outermost JSJ-pieces. Let $f:\\widehat{\\pi_1M}\\to \\widehat{\\pi_1N}$ be an isomorphism, and let $f_\\bullet: (\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}^M},\\Gamma^M)\\xrightarrow{\\cong}(\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}^N},\\Gamma^N)$ be the congruent isomorphism given by \\autoref{THM: JSJ}. Then by \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem1}), $\\F(r)=s$. In particular, $M_r$ and $N_s$ are either both hyperbolic or both Seifert fibered by (\\ref{lem2}) of the same lemma.  \n\nWhen $M_r$ and $N_s$ are hyperbolic, it follows from \\cite[Proposition 3.3]{Xu24b} that $f$ respects the peripheral structure. This can also be deduced from \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem4}). Thus, in this case, the conclusion follows from \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}.\n\nNow we assume that $M_r$ and $N_s$ are Seifert fibered. Then, according to \\cite[Theorem 4.18]{Bud06}, the outermost Seifert fibered piece of a satellite knot can only be a cable  space $C_{p,q}=(S_{0,2}; p/q)$ ($\\abs{q}\\ge 2$) or a composite space $S_{0,n}\\times S^1$ ($n\\ge 3$), where $S_{0,2}$ denotes the annulus, and $S_{0,n}$ denotes $S^2$ removing $n$ open disks. Note that when the outermost piece is a cable space, the degree of the root in the JSJ-graph is $1$, and when  the outermost piece is a composite space, the degree of the root in the JSJ-graph is greater than $1$. Thus, the graph isomorphism $\\F:\\Gamma^M\\to \\Gamma^N$ implies that $M_r$ and $N_s$ are either both cable spaces or both composite spaces. When they are both composite spaces, both $J$ and $K$ are non-prime. Thus, by assumption, $M_r=C_{p,q}$ and $N_s=C_{p',q'}$ are cable spaces.\n\nConsequently, $J$ is the $(p,q)$-cable of the companion knot $c(J)$, and $K$ is the $(p',q')$-cable of the companion knot $c(K)$. We may assume with out loss of generality that $q>0$ and $q'>0$.  By assumption, $c(J)$ and $c(K)$ are hyperbolic knots or satellite knots containing hyperbolic pieces. Let $M^0=M-M_r$ which is the exterior of $c(J)$, and let $N^0=N-N_s$ which is the exterior of $c(K)$. The congruent isomorphism $f_\\bullet$ restricts to a congruent isomorphism $f_\\bullet^0:(\\widehat{{\\mathcal{G}}^{M^0}},\\Gamma^M-r)\\to (\\widehat{{\\mathcal{G}}^{N^0}},\\Gamma^N-s)$. Then $f_\\bullet^0$ also induces an isomorphism $f^0:\\widehat{\\pi_1M^0}\\to \\widehat{\\pi_1N^0}$ according to \\cite[Proposition 3.11]{Xu24a}.  For any $v\\in V(\\Gamma^M-r)$,  $f_v^0=f_v$ respects the peripheral structure, as is completely witnessed in the JSJ-graph. Thus, by \\autoref{LEM: JSJ}~(\\ref{lem4}), $f^0$ respects the peripheral structure. Then, by \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}, up to a possible mirror image, $\\widetilde A_{c(J)}\\doteq \\widetilde A_{c(K)}$.\n\nLet us be precise about the possible mirror image. \nSince $M^0$ and $N^0$ are either hyperbolic or mixed, by \\autoref{mainthm: regular} and \\autoref{THM: Mixed peripheral} respectively, $f^0$ is peripheral regular. $\\partial M^0$ is endowed with  a preferred meridian-longitude basis $(m_{c(J)}, l_{c(J)})$, and $\\partial N^0$ is endowed with  a preferred meridian-longitude basis $(m_{c(K)}, l_{c(K)})$. According to \\autoref{THM: knot boundary}, there exists $g\\in \\widehat{\\pi_1(N^0)}$ such that $f^0(m_{c(J)})=g^{-1}  (m_{c(K)})^{\\pm 1}  g$ and $f^0(l_{c(J)})=g^{-1}  (l_{c(K)})^{\\pm 1}  g $. Up to possibly  reversing the orientation of the  orientation of the ambient space $S^3$, and possibly reversing the orientation of the knot $K$ along with its companion knot $c(K)$, we may assume $f^0(m_{c(J)})=g^{-1}   m_{c(K)}  g$ and $f^0(l_{c(J)})=g^{-1}   l_{c(K)}  g $. In this case, as shown in the proof of  \\autoref{THM: A-polynomial peripheral}, $\\widetilde A_{c(J)}\\doteq \\widetilde A_{c(K)}$. \n\nWe follow this adjusted orientation. Then the cabling parameters $(p,q)$ and $(p',q')$ can be determined as follows. For the knot $J$, the cabling parameter is $(p,q)$ if and only if the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p,q}=M_r$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (pm_{c(J)}+ql_{c(J)})$ at the JSJ-torus $\\partial M^0$. Similarly, the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p',q'}=N_s$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (p'm_{c(K)}+q'l_{c(K)})$ at the JSJ-torus $\\partial N^0$. Denote $\\partial f^0 = C_g\\circ f|_{\\overline{\\pi_1\\partial M^0}}$. In fact, $\\partial f^0$ does not depend on the choice of the element $g$ that induces the orientation, according to \\cite[Proposition 6.7]{Xu24a}. Then the coherence relation (\\ref{butterfly}) implies a commutative diagram\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\usebox{\\gluecableequ}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are gluing maps at the JSJ-tori. It is shown in \\cite[Theorem 5.5]{Wil17} that $f_r$ preserves the closure of the fiber subgroup. Indeed, let $h_M\\in \\pi_1\\partial_0 M_r\\subseteq \\pi_1M_r$ and $h_N\\in \\pi_1\\partial_0 N_s\\subseteq \\pi_1N_s$ represent the regular fibers. If we write these peripheral subgroups in the addditive convention of $\\widehat{\\Z}$-modules, then $\\partial f_r^0(h_M)= \\lambda\\cdot h_N$ for some $\\lambda\\in \\Zx$. Note that $$\\partial f^0(\\widehat{\\varphi}(h_M))=\\partial f^0(\\pm (pm_{c(J)}+ql_{c(J)}))= \\pm (pm_{c(K)}+ql_{c(K)}),$$ while $$\\widehat{\\psi}(\\partial f^0_r( h_M))= \\widehat{\\psi}(\\lambda h_N )=\\pm \\lambda(p'm_{c(K)}+q'l_{c(K)}).$$ Thus, it follows from \\autoref{LEM: Zx+-1} that $\\lambda=\\pm1$ and $(p,q)=\\pm (p',q')$. As we have assumed $q,q'>0$, we finally obtain that $(p,q)=(p',q')$.\n\nThus, by the cabling formula \\autoref{THM: cable formula}, $\\widetilde A_{c(J)}\\doteq \\widetilde  A_{c(K)}$ and $(p,q)=(p',q')$ implies that $\\widetilde A_{J}\\doteq \\widetilde A_{K}$. \n\n\\iffalse\n\n\n\n\nThen the JSJ-torus $\\partial M^0$ is endowed with  a preferred meridian-longitude basis $(m_{c(J)}, l_{c(J)})$, and the cabling parameter is $(p,q)$ if and only if the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p,q}=M_r$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (pm_{c(J)}+ql_{c(J)})$. Similarly,     the regular fiber of the cable space $C_{p',q'}=N_s$ is glued to the boundary slope $\\pm (p'm_{c(K)}+q'l_{c(K)})$.\\fi"
