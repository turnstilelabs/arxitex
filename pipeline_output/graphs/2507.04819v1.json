      "proof": "Let $u,v\\in A^*$ be reduced with $uv=1$ in $M$.  We prove by induction on $|u|$ that $(u,v)\\in \\langle X\\cup Y\\rangle$. If $u=1$, then since $uv=1$ in $M$ and $v$ is reduced, we must have $v=1$. Proceeding by induction, if $|u|>0$,  then $uv$ is not reduced (being $1$ in $M$), and so we can apply a rewrite rule to it.  Since $u,v$ are reduced, the left-hand side of any applicable rewrite rule cuts across $(u,v)$.  But the left-hand side of any rewrite rule is invertible and nonempty.  Hence there is an invertible word cutting across $(u,v)$.  Let  $\\delta$ be the minimal invertible word cutting across $(u,v)$; this exists by Proposition~\\ref{p:lattice.cuts}.  Write $u\\equiv u'\\delta_1$ and $v\\equiv \\delta_2v'$ with $\\delta\\equiv \\delta_1\\delta_2$. Suppose first that $\\delta_1$ has no invertible suffix.  We compute $(u,v)=(u',\\delta v')(\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\delta\\inv)$.  Note that $|u'|<|u|$ and $u'\\delta v'\\equiv uv$, and hence is $1$ in $M$.  So $(u',\\delta v')\\in \\langle X\\cup Y\\rangle$ by induction, noting that $u'$ is a reduced word, whereas $(\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\delta\\inv)\\in X$ by minimality of $\\delta$ which implies $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2)$ has height zero.  Otherwise, $\\delta_1\\equiv \\delta_1'\\gamma$ where $\\gamma$ is a nonempty invertible suffix.  Since $\\delta_1$ is reduced, $\\gamma\\in \\Delta^*$ by Lemma~\\ref{lem:Zhang:Irred}.  Therefore, $(\\gamma,\\gamma\\inv)\\in \\langle Y\\rangle$.  But then $(u,v) = (u'\\delta_1'\\gamma,v) = (u'\\delta_1',\\ov{\\gamma v})(\\gamma,\\gamma\\inv)$, where $u' \\delta_1'$ is a reduced word since it is a subword of the reduced word $u$. Since $u'\\delta_1'\\ov{\\gamma v}=uv=1$ in $M$, and $|u'\\delta_1'|<|u|$, we deduce that  $(u'\\delta_1'\\gamma,v)\\in \\langle X\\cup Y\\rangle$ by induction, and hence $(u,v)\\in \\langle X\\cup Y\\rangle$.\n\nFinally, we show that conditions (1)--(4) together imply that $\\delta\\equiv\\delta_1\\delta_2 \\in \\Delta$ and hence the set $X$ is finite. There are two cases to consider. \n\nFirst suppose that $\\delta\\equiv\\delta_1\\delta_2$ is not reduced. Since $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are both reduced by (1) it follows that the left hand side $\\mu \\in \\Delta^+$ of some rewrite rule cuts across $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2)$.          \nWrite $\\delta_1\\delta_2 \\equiv \\delta_1' \\mu_1 \\mu_2 \\delta_2'$ where $\\delta_1 \\equiv \\delta_1' \\mu_1$, $\\delta_2 \\equiv \\mu_2 \\delta_2'$ and $\\mu_1\\mu_2 \\in \\Delta^+$ with $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ both non-empty words. Since by (4) the word $\\delta_1$ has no invertible suffix, it follows that $\\mu_1 \\not\\in \\Delta^+$ hence there is a word $\\gamma \\in \\Delta$ such that $\\gamma$ cuts across $(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)$. Since by (3) we have that $(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)$ has height zero this is only possible if $\\delta \\equiv \\delta_1 \\delta_2 \\equiv \\gamma \\in \\Delta$. This completes the proof that in this case $\\delta \\equiv \\delta_1\\delta_2 \\in \\Delta$. \n\nNext we consider the case that $\\delta\\equiv\\delta_1\\delta_2$ is reduced. Since $\\delta_1\\delta_2$ is reduced, then as it is invertible it belongs to $\\Delta^*$ by Lemma~\\ref{lem:Zhang:Irred}.  Since $\\delta_1\\notin \\Delta^*$ (being noninvertible), the expression of $\\delta_1\\delta_2$ as a product of words from $\\Delta$ must involve an element $\\delta'\\in\\Delta$ cutting across $(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)$.  Since any element of $\\Delta$ is invertible, we deduce that $\\delta_1\\delta_2\\equiv \\delta' \\in \\Delta$ by definition of height $0$. This completes the proof that in this case $\\delta \\equiv \\delta_1\\delta_2 \\in \\Delta$. \n\nWe have shown that the conditions (1)--(4) together imply that $\\delta\\equiv\\delta_1\\delta_2 \\in \\Delta$ and hence, since $\\Delta$ is finite, the set $X$ is also finite."

So we may assume that $X\\neq \\emptyset$.\nFor each $x \\in X$ if $x^i=x^j$ for some $i,j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $i > j$ then since $N$ is a cancellative monoid this would imply $x^{i-j}=1$ and thus $x$ is invertible. But if $x$ were invertible it would imply $Ax=A$ contradicting the hypotheses of the lemma. \nHence, \neach $x\\in X$ generates a free submonoid $x^*$. \nWe want to show that $N \\cong G\\ast \\Asterisk_{\\substack{x\\in X}}x^*$.  By assumption, the natural map from the free product to $N$ is surjective.  The action of $N$ on $A$ inflates to  $G\\ast \\Asterisk_{\\substack{x\\in X}}x^*$ via this natural map.   First note that if \nan element $\\alpha$ of the free product $G\\ast \\Asterisk_{\\substack{x\\in X}}x^*$\nis in normal form with last syllable of type $x^*$, then $A\\alpha\\subseteq Ax$. \nIf $\\alpha$ has last syllable of type $G$, there are two cases.  If $\\alpha\\in G\\setminus \\{1\\}$, then $A\\alpha=A$ and $Ax\\alpha\\subseteq A_0$ for all $x\\in X$; if $\\alpha=\\alpha'x^kg$ with $x\\in X$, $k>0$ and $g\\in G\\setminus \\{1\\}$, then $A\\alpha\\subseteq A_0$.  It follows that if $\\alpha$ is a nonempty normal form, then it acts nontrivially on $A$, and we can determine the type of its last syllable from its action on $A$.   \n\n Suppose that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are normal forms for the free product.  We induct on the sum of their syllable lengths to show that if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ represent the same element of $N$, then they are equal in the free product. By the previous paragraph, we may assume that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are nonempty and  their last syllables have the same type.\nSuppose first that  $\\alpha = \\alpha'x^k$ and $\\beta=\\beta'x^m$ with $x\\in X$ and $\\alpha',\\beta'$ of one shorter syllable length.  Without loss of generality assume that $k\\leq m$.  Then cancelling $x^k$ we get $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta'x^{m-k}$ represent the same element of $N$.  By induction, since $\\alpha'$ does not end in an $x^*$-syllable, we must have that $m=k$ and  $\\alpha'=\\beta'$ in the free product.   Next suppose that $\\alpha=\\alpha' g$ and $\\beta =\\beta'g'$ where $g,g'\\in G\\setminus \\{1\\}$ and $\\alpha',\\beta'$ have syllable length one shorter.  Then $\\alpha'=\\beta' g'g\\inv$ in $N$.  Since $\\alpha'$ does not end in a $G$-syllable, we deduce by induction that $g'g\\inv =1$ and $\\alpha'=\\beta'$ in the free product.  This completes the proof."

We know that $N$ is generated by $X\\cup Y$ by Lemma~\\ref{lem_NGenAdvanced_newExtra}.  We have already pointed out that $N$ is cancellative. Note that if $x=(\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\delta\\inv)\\in X$ with $\\delta_1\\delta_2\\equiv \\delta\\in \\Delta$ and $\\delta_1$ having no invertible suffix, then $\\delta_1$ is right invertible (as $\\delta$ is invertible), and hence is not left invertible.  It follows that $x$ is not left invertible, and so  $Nx\\subsetneq N$ for all $x\\in X$.  We now prove that the collection $\\{Nx: x\\in X\\}$ is pairwise disjoint.  \n\n\nLet $\\pi\\in N$ with $\\pi=(\\pi_{\\ell},\\pi_r)$ with $\\pi_{\\ell},\\pi_r$ reduced words.  If $(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)\\in X$ with $\\mu\\gamma\\equiv \\tau\\in \\Delta$, we shall show that we can uniquely recover $(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)$ from $(\\pi_\\ell\\mu, \\gamma\\tau\\inv \\pi_r)=\\pi(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)$.\nWe need a claim in order to do this.  We continue to write $\\ov{w}$ for the reduced form of $w$.\n\n\n\\begin{Claim}\\label{claim:1}\nLet $\\pi=(\\pi_\\ell,\\pi_r)\\in N$ with $\\pi_{\\ell},\\pi_r$ reduced, $(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)\\in X$ with $\\tau\\equiv \\mu\\gamma$ and $\\delta\\in \\Delta^*$ reduced.  Then\n\\[\\pi(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)(\\delta,\\delta\\inv) = (\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu\\delta,\\delta\\inv\\gamma\\ov{\\tau\\inv \\pi_r})\\] and $\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu\\delta$ and $\\gamma\\ov{\\tau\\inv \\pi_r}$ are both reduced.  \n\\end{Claim}  \n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim~\\ref{claim:1}]\nBy assumption $\\pi_{\\ell}$, $\\pi_r$ and $\\delta$ are reduced.  The words $\\mu,\\gamma$ are reduced by the definition of $X$ in Lemma~\\ref{lem_NGenAdvanced_newExtra}.  First we observe that $\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu$ is reduced.  This follows since $\\pi_{\\ell}$ and $\\mu$ are reduced, and no rewrite rule can be applied with the left-hand side of the rewrite rule including both letters in $\\pi_{\\ell}$ and in  $\\mu$ since the left-hand side of every rewrite rule belongs to $\\Delta^+$, and hence is invertible,  and that would then give a nonempty left invertible prefix of $\\mu$, something we already observed in Lemma~\\ref{lem:ht.zero} it does not have.  Dually, $\\gamma\\ov{\\tau\\inv\\pi_r}$ is reduced because no rewrite rule can be applied to $\\gamma$ or $\\overline{\\tau^{-1}\\pi_r}$ since they are reduced, and\nfurthermore, any rewrite rule applied across both of these words (i.e., involving letters from both of them) would contradict the fact (proved in Lemma~\\ref{lem:ht.zero}) that $\\gamma$ has no nonempty right invertible suffix, as the left-hand side of any rewrite rule is nonempty and invertible.  \n\nFinally we show that $\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu\\delta$ is reduced.  Since the left hand side of any rewrite rule is nonempty and invertible, and as $\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu$ and $\\delta$ are reduced, it is enough to show that $\\delta$ is a maximal invertible subword of $\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu\\delta$ by Lemma~\\ref{lemma:OZ}.  By definition of the generating set $X$ the word $\\mu$ does not have an invertible suffix.\nIt follows that there is no suffix $\\mu''$ of $\\mu$ such that $\\mu''\\delta$ is invertible.\nA word of the form $\\sigma \\mu\\delta$ cannot be invertible since if it were, then $\\sigma \\mu$ would be invertible, implying  $\\mu$ is left invertible which is a contradiction, since it is right invertible but not invertible.\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\n  \\end{proof}\n\nFrom Claim~\\ref{claim:1} it follows that $\\pi_{\\ell}\\mu$ and $\\gamma\\ov{\\tau\\inv\\pi_r}$ are reduced.\nWe now recover $(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)$ uniquely from $(\\pi_\\ell\\mu,\\gamma\\ov{\\tau\\inv \\pi_r})$ in the following way.\nConsider all the invertible words cutting across this pair.\nThere is at least one such word since $\\mu\\gamma$ is invertible and $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ are both non-empty words by definition of $X$.\nBy Proposition~\\ref{p:lattice.cuts} the set of invertible words cutting across this pair is a lattice\nunder inclusion. \nWe claim that the word\n$\\mu \\gamma$ is the unique minimal element of this lattice.  This word is minimal because, by definition of $X$, the pair $(\\mu, \\gamma)$ has height zero.  In a lattice minimal elements are unique.  It follows that we can recover $(\\mu, \\gamma\\tau\\inv)$ from $(\\pi_\\ell\\mu,\\gamma\\ov{\\tau\\inv \\pi_r})$, and hence the collection $\\{Nx: x\\in X\\}$ is pairwise disjoint.\n\n\n\nLet $N_0$ be the complement of $\\bigsqcup_{x\\in X}Nx$.  By the Ping Pong Lemma, it remains to show that $Nx(g,g\\inv)\\subseteq N_0$ for all $x\\in X$ and $g\\neq 1$ in $G$.  Indeed, let $x=(\\mu,\\gamma\\tau\\inv)\\in X$, and let $\\delta\\in \\Delta^*$ be reduced representing $g$, whence $\\delta$ is nonempty.  Let $\\pi=(\\pi_\\ell,\\pi_r)\\in N$ with $\\pi_\\ell,\\pi_r$ reduced.  Then \n$\\pi x(g,g\\inv) = (\\pi_\\ell\\mu\\delta,\\delta\\inv \\gamma\\tau\\inv \\pi_r)$ and $\\pi_\\ell\\mu\\delta$ is reduced by Claim~\\ref{claim:1}.  Now if $\\pi x(g,g\\inv)=\\pi'x'$ with $\\pi'=(\\pi_\\ell',\\pi_r')\\in N$, $x'=(\\mu',\\gamma'(\\tau')\\inv)\\in X$, $\\tau'\\equiv \\mu'\\gamma'\\in \\Delta$ and $\\pi_\\ell',\\pi_r'$ reduced, then we would have $\\pi'x'=(\\pi_\\ell'\\mu',\\gamma'(\\tau')\\inv\\pi_r')$ with $\\pi_\\ell'\\mu'$ reduced by Claim~\\ref{claim:1}.  Thus $\\pi_\\ell'\\mu'\\equiv\\pi_\\ell\\mu\\delta$.  We cannot have $\\delta$ as a suffix of $\\mu'$ since $\\mu'$ has no invertible suffix and $\\delta$ is nonempty.   If $\\mu'$ is a suffix of $\\delta$, then it is left invertible, but it is also right invertible since $\\mu'\\gamma'$ is invertible.  This contradicts that $\\mu'$ has no invertible suffix. Thus $\\pi x(g,g\\inv)\\in N_0$.  This completes the proof that $X$ freely generates $X^*$ and  $N\\cong G\\ast X^*$ by the Ping Pong Lemma."

We conclude that $\\mathcal B$ is a generating set for $M\\times M$ as a right $N$-set.  It remains, to show each element of $M\\times M$ has only one expression in the form $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)(n_1,n_2)$ with $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)\\in \\mathcal B$ and $(n_1,n_2)\\in N$.\n\nSuppose that $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)\\in \\mathcal B$ and let $x,y$ be reduced words with $xy=1$.  We show that $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$ can be recovered from the right-hand side of $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)(x,y) = (\\alpha_1x,y\\alpha_2)$.  Note that by definition of $\\mathcal B$, $\\alpha_1$ has no invertible suffix.   First we claim that $\\alpha_1x$ is reduced.  Indeed, since $\\alpha_1$ and $x$ are reduced, any rewrite rule that is applicable must cut across $(\\alpha_1,x)$.  Since the left-hand side of a rewrite rule is nonempty and invertible, this means we can write $\\alpha_1\\equiv \\alpha\\beta$ and $x\\equiv \\gamma\\delta$ with $\\beta\\gamma$ invertible and $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ nonempty.  Since $x$ is right invertible, we deduce that $\\gamma$ is invertible and hence $\\beta$ is invertible, contradicting that $\\alpha_1$ has no invertible suffix.\nConsider $(\\alpha_1x,\\ov{y\\alpha_2})$. \nLet $\\mu$ be the longest invertible word that cuts across $(\\alpha_1x,\\ov{y\\alpha_2})$ if such a word exists, while if no such word exists then let $\\mu$ be the longest invertible suffix of $\\alpha_1 x$, which could possibly be empty. We claim that $\\alpha_1x\\ov{y\\alpha_2}\\equiv \\alpha_1\\mu\\nu$ with $\\ov{\\mu\\nu}=\\alpha_2$.  It will then follow that we can recover $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$ from $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)(x,y)$.    \n\n\\begin{sloppypar}\nIndeed, to prove the claim let $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots a_mw_m$ in Otto-Zhang normal form. By Lemma~\\ref{lemma:OZ}, each $w_j$ is reduced and in $\\Delta^*$.   Then by definition of $\\mathcal B$, we have some $i$ with $\\alpha_1\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}$ and $\\alpha_2\\equiv w_{i-1}a_i\\cdots a_mw_m$.   Then $\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}xyw_{i-1}a_i\\cdots a_mw_m$.  By Lemma~\\ref{lem:unions:of:invertible:general}, it follows that any maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2$ is either a maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1$, $\\alpha_2$ or contains $xy$.  But since $xy=1$ in $M$ and $w_{i-1}$ is maximal invertible in $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2$, it follows that $xyw_{i-1}$ is the maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}xyw_{i-1}a_i\\cdots a_mw_m$ containing $xy$. Since every maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2$ is either a maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1$, $\\alpha_2$ or contains $xy$, it follows that the Otto Zhang normal form of the word $\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2$ is\n\\[\n\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}(xyw_{i-1})a_i\\cdots a_mw_m\n\\]\nwhere the maximal invertible subwords in this normal form are the words\n\\[\nw_0, \\ldots, w_{i-2}, xyw_{i-1}, w_i, \\ldots, w_m. \n\\]\nSince $xyw_{i-1}$ is invertible it follows that $y w_{i-1}$ is left invertible. Since $a_i w_i \\cdots a_mw_m$ has no invertible prefix it follows that no invertible word cuts across the pair\n\\[\n(y w_{i-1}, a_i w_i \\cdots a_mw_m).\n\\]\nIndeed, if $\\sigma \\equiv \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$ were an invertible word that cuts across this pair with $\\sigma_2$ a prefix of   \n$a_i w_i \\cdots a_mw_m$, then $\\sigma_1$ is left invertible since it is a suffix of the left invertible word $y w_{i-1}$, and $\\sigma_1$ is right invertible since it is a prefix of the invertible word $\\sigma$. Then $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma$ are invertible and thus $\\sigma_2$ is an invertible prefix of $a_i w_i \\cdots a_mw_m$ which is a contradiction. It follows that every invertible subword of the word       \n\\[\ny w_{i-1} a_i w_i \\cdots a_mw_m\n\\]\nis contained in either a subword of $y w_{i-1}$ or else is a subword of $a_i w_i \\cdots a_mw_m$.\nIt follows that the Otto-Zhang normal form of $y\\alpha_2$ is graphically equal to the product of the Otto-Zhang normal form of $yw_{i-1}$ and $\\nu:=a_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m$.  We conclude from Lemma~\\ref{lemma:OZ} that $\\ov{y\\alpha_2} \\equiv \\ov{yw_{i-1}}a_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m$.  Then\n\\[\\alpha_1 x \\ov{y\\alpha_2} \\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}x\\ov{yw_{i-1}}a_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m.\\]\nNow there are two cases.\nIf there is an invertible word that cuts across $(\\alpha_1x,\\ov{y\\alpha_2})$ then it follows that $\\mu = x\\ov{yw_{i-1}}$ since $xy=1$, $x\\ov{yw_{i-1}}$ is invertible, and $w_{i-1}$ is a maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2$.  Therefore, $\\alpha_1\\ov{y\\alpha_2}\\equiv \\alpha_1\\mu\\nu$ and $\\ov{\\mu\\nu}=\\alpha_2$.\nIn the other case there is no invertible word that cuts across $(\\alpha_1x,\\ov{y\\alpha_2})$.\nIn this case since $x \\ov{yw_{i-1}}$ is invertible, either $x$ is empty or $\\ov{yw_{i-1}}$ is empty. If $x$ is empty then $y$ is also empty since $xy=1$ and $x$ and $y$ are reduced. Therefore, $(\\alpha_1 x, \\ov{y \\alpha_2}) = (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)$, and by definition of $\\mathcal{B}$ the word $\\alpha_1$ has no non-trivial invertible suffix, so $\\mu$ is empty. So we recover $\\alpha_2 = \\nu = \\ov{\\mu \\nu}$.  \nOtherwise, $\\ov{yw_{i-1}}$ is the empty word so\n\\[\\alpha_1 x \\ov{y\\alpha_2} \\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}xa_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m.\\] \nIn this case in $M$ we have $x = xy w_{i-1} = w_{i-1}$. In particular $x$ is invertible. Furthermore\n\\[\\alpha_1 x \\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}x \\]\nSuppose that $x$ is not the longest invertible suffix of the word $\\alpha_1 x$; say, e.g., $z$ is a longer such suffix.  Then since $xy w_{i-1}$ and $z$ are both invertible with $x$ a suffix of $z$, it would follow \nfrom Lemma~\\ref{lem:unions:of:invertible:general} \nthat $zyw_{i-1}$ is an invertible word strictly containing $xy w_{i-1}$ contradicting the fact proved above that $xyw_{i-1}$ is a maximal invertible subword of $\\alpha_1xy\\alpha_2$. Hence in this case $x$ is the longest invertible suffix of the word $\\alpha_1 x$. So by definition $\\mu \\equiv x$ and\n\\[\\alpha_1 x \\ov{y\\alpha_2} \\equiv \\alpha_1 xa_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m \\equiv \\alpha_1 \\mu \\nu \\] \nand\n\\[ \\ov{\\mu \\nu} = \\ov{xa_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m } = \\ov{w_{i-1}a_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m } = \\alpha_2 \\]\nsince in this case, as we saw above, $x = w_{i-1}$ in $M$. This completes the proof that we can recover $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)$ from $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)(x,y)$.\n\\end{sloppypar}\n\nNext suppose that $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)\\in \\mathcal B$ and $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)(x,y)=(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)(x',y')$ with $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')\\in N$.  We show that $(x,y)=(x',y')$.  Indeed, by Corollary~\\cite[Corollary~3.8]{GraySteinbergDocumenta}, $M$ is a free right $R_1$-set and a free left $L_1$-set. Note that $R_1,L_1$ are cancellative monoids. Hence the equations $\\alpha_1x=\\alpha_1x'$ and $y\\alpha_2=y'\\alpha_2$ imply that $x=x'$ and $y=y'$, as required."

Let $w'\\equiv a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_m$.   We claim that the $m$-component of $\\overleftrightarrow{\\Gamma}/N$ is isomorphic as a labelled graph to the linear automaton $\\mathcal A(w')$ for $w'$ with vertex set $0,\\ldots, m$ and an edge labelled by $a_i$ from $i-1$ to $i$ for $1\\leq i\\leq m$.  It will then follow that  $\\overleftrightarrow{\\Gamma}/N$ is a forest.\n\nDefine a cellular map from the $m$-component of $\\overleftrightarrow{\\Gamma}$ to $A(w')$ as follows.  If $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\in A^*$ are reduced with $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2=m$, then $\\alpha_1\\equiv w_0a_1\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}w_{i-1}'$ and $\\alpha_2\\equiv w_{i-1}''a_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m$ with $\\ov{w_{i-1}'w_{i-1}''}=w_{i-1}$ by Lemma~\\ref{lem:OttoZhang} and Lemma~\\ref{lemma:OZ}.  Both $w_{i-1}'$ and $w_{i-1}''$ can be empty.  Send $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$ to $i-1$.  Notice in particular that the basis element $(w_0a_1\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}, w_{i-1}a_iw_i\\cdots a_mw_m)$ is sent to $i-1$, and so this map is surjective on vertices.  By Remark~\\ref{remark:useful.basis}, this map factors through $(M\\times M)/N$, and the induced map is injective on vertices.    An edge in the $m$-component of  $\\overleftrightarrow{\\Gamma}$ has the form $(\\mu,a,\\gamma)$ where $\\mu,\\gamma\\in A^*$ are reduced, $a\\in A$ and $\\mu a\\gamma=m$.  By Lemma~\\ref{lem:OttoZhang} and Lemma~\\ref{lemma:OZ}, we have two cases.  The first is that $\\mu\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1}w_{i-1}'$, $\\gamma\\equiv w_{i-1}''a_i\\cdots a_mw_m$ where $\\ov{w_{i-1}'aw_{i-1}''}=w_{i-1}$.  In this case, by Remark~\\ref{remark:useful.basis}, this edge is between two vertices in the same weak $N$-orbit, namely that of the basis element $(w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-2}a_{i-1},w_{i-1}a_i\\cdots a_mw_m)$.  The second case is that $\\mu\\equiv w_0a_0\\cdots w_{i-1}$, $\\gamma\\equiv w_i\\cdots a_mw_0$ and $a=a_i$.  In this case, initial vertex is in the weak $N$-orbit of the basis element $(w_0a_0\\cdots a_{i-1}, w_{i-1}a_i\\cdots a_mw_m)$, whereas the terminal vertex is in the weak $N$-orbit of the basis element $(w_0\\cdots w_{i-1}a_i, w_i\\cdots a_mw_m)$.  We map the corresponding edge of $\\overleftrightarrow{\\Gamma}/N$ to the edge labeled $a_i$ from $i-1$ to $i$.  This completes the proof of the isomorphism."

First of all we claim that $(u,a,v)\\in E$ if and only if the distinguished occurrence of $a$ is not any of the $a_i$.\n Suppose first that $a_i$ is the distinguished occurrence of $a$ for some $i$, then $uav$ is reduced by Lemma~\\ref{lemma:OZ} (since $u,v$ are reduced, and hence their subwords $w_j$ are reduced) and\n\\begin{align*}\n(u,av) & = (w_0a_1\\cdots a_{i-1}w_{i-1},a_i\\cdots a_mw_m) &  \\text{and}\\\\\n(ua,v) &= (w_0\\cdots w_{i-1}a_i, w_ia_{i+1}\\cdots a_mw_m)\n\\end{align*}\nare in different weak $N$-orbits by Remark~\\ref{remark:useful.basis}, as $(u a,v)$ is a basis element and \\[(w_0a_1\\cdots a_{i-1},w_{i-1}a_i\\cdots a_mw_m)\\] is the basis element in the weak orbit of $(u,av)$.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that $a$ is a letter of some $w_i$.  Then $u\\equiv w_0a_1\\cdots a_iw_i'$ and $v\\equiv w_i''a_{i+1}\\cdots a_mw_m$ with $w_i\\equiv w_i'aw_i''$.  It follows from Remark~\\ref{remark:useful.basis} that $(ua,v)$ and $(u,av)$ both belong to the weak $N$-orbit of the basis element $(w_0a_1\\cdots a_i,\\ov{w_i}a_{i+1}\\cdots a_mw_m)$.  In particular, each element of $\\mathcal C$ belongs to $E$.\n\nWe must now show that if $(u,a,v)\\in E$, then $(u,a,v) = (m_1,m_2)(\\delta_1,a,\\delta_2)$ for a unique $(m_1,m_2)\\in M\\times M^{op}$ and $(\\delta_1,a,\\delta_2)\\in \\mathcal C$.  As before let $uav\\equiv w_0a_1\\cdots a_mw_m$ in Otto-Zhang normal form.  Then, by the above, there is a unique $i$ such that the distinguished $a$ occurs in $w_i$.  Since $w_i$ is invertible, there is a unique minimal invertible subword $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$ containing this $a$ by Proposition~\\ref{p:lattice.vers1}.  Write $u\\equiv u'\\delta_1$ and $v\\equiv \\delta_2v'$.  Then $(\\delta_1,a,\\delta_2)\\in \\mathcal C$ and $(u,a,v) = (u',v')(\\delta_1,a,\\delta_2)$.  We claim that these choices are unique.\n\nClearly the letter $a$ is uniquely determined by $(u,a,v)$.  Suppose that $\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta_1',\\delta_2'$ are reduced with $(\\alpha,\\beta)(\\delta_1',a,\\delta_2')=(u,a,v)$ and $(\\delta_1',a,\\delta_2')\\in \\mathcal C$.  Then $(u,a,v)=(\\alpha\\delta_1',a,\\delta_2'\\beta)$.  We claim that $\\alpha\\delta_1'$ and $\\delta_2'\\beta$ are reduced.  We handle just the first case as the second is dual.   Since $\\alpha,\\delta_1'$ are reduced and each left-hand side of a rewrite rule is nonempty and invertible, it follows that the only way we can apply a  rewrite rule is if it overlaps $\\alpha$ and $\\delta_1'$.   This would imply that $\\delta_1'$ has a left invertible prefix.   Now any prefix of $\\delta_1'$ is right invertible since $\\delta_1'a\\delta_2'$ is invertible.   But then we obtain a contradiction to the fact that $\\delta_1'$ has no invertible prefix by Proposition~\\ref{p:lattice.vers1}.  Thus $\\alpha\\delta_1'\\equiv u'\\delta_1$ and, dually, $\\delta_2'\\beta\\equiv \\delta_2v'$.  Then $\\delta_1'a\\delta_2'$ and $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$ are both minimal invertible subwords of $uav\\equiv \\alpha\\delta_1'a\\delta_2'\\beta$ containing the distinguished $a$.  By uniqueness of the  minimal invertible subword containing $a$, which follows from Proposition~\\ref{p:lattice.vers1}, we conclude that $\\delta_1'a\\delta_2'\\equiv \\delta_1a\\delta_2$, with the distinguished occurrences of $a$ the same.  Thus $\\delta_1\\equiv \\delta_1'$, $\\delta_2\\equiv \\delta_2'$, $u'\\equiv \\alpha$ and $v'\\equiv \\beta$. This establishes the uniqueness, and so $\\mathcal C$ is a basis.\n\nTo prove that $\\mathcal C$ is finite we show that if $(\\delta_1,a,\\delta_2)\\in \\mathcal C$, then $\\delta_1a\\delta_2\\in \\Delta$.  We begin by showing that $\\delta_1a\\delta_2\\in \\Delta^*$.  If $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$ is reduced, then it belongs to $\\Delta^*$ by Lemma~\\ref{lem:Zhang:Irred} since it is invertible.  Otherwise, we can apply a rewrite rule to $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$.  Since $\\delta_1,\\delta_2$ are reduced, the left-hand side of the rewrite rule must contain $a$.  Since each left-hand side of a rewrite rule is in $\\Delta^+$, hence invertible, and $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$ has no proper invertible subword containing the distinguished $a$, we must have that $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$ is the left-hand side of a rewrite rule, and hence in $\\Delta^*$.  It follows now that there is a subword of $\\delta_1a\\delta_2$ containing $a$ that belongs to $\\Delta$. But then since elements of $\\Delta$ are invertible, we deduce by minimality that $\\delta_1a\\delta_2\\in \\Delta$.  We conclude that $\\mathcal C$ is finite as $\\Delta$ is finite."

The augmented cellular chain complex\n\\[\n0 \\rightarrow C_1(F) \\rightarrow C_0(F) \\rightarrow H_0(F)\\cong \\ZM \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nis a bimodule resolution of $\\ZM$ with exactness following from $F$ being a forest.\n\nNow $C_1(F)$ is the quotient of a free bimodule on $A$, namely $\\mathbb Z[M\\times A\\times M]$, by $\\mathbb ZE$ where $E$ is the finitely generated free $M\\times M^{op}$-set from Theorem~\\ref{thm:E:Gen:Set2}.  Thus we have a free resolution\n \\[0\\longrightarrow \\mathbb ZE\\longrightarrow \\mathbb Z[M\\times A\\times M]\\to  C_1(F)\\to 0\\] by finitely generated free bimodules, and so $C_1(F)$ is $\\FPinfty$ and has\nprojective dimension at most 1.\n\nWe have $C_0(F)\\cong \\Z[(M\\times M)/N]\\cong \\Z[M \\times M]\\otimes_{\\ZN} \\Z$.\nIn Theorem~\\ref{thm:FreeProductStructure} we proved that $N$ is a free product of the group of units $G$ and\na finitely generated free monoid.\nTogether with~\\cite[Corollary 4.13]{GraySteinbergDocumenta} this then implies that\n$N$ is of type left-$\\FPn$, and hence $\\Z$ is a left $\\ZN$-module of type $\\FPn$. Let $F_\\bullet\\to \\Z\\to 0$ be a free resolution of $\\Z$ by $\\ZN$-modules with $F_i$ finitely generated for $0\\leq i\\leq n$.  Then since $M\\times M^{op}$ is a free right $N$-set, it follows that $\\Z[M \\times M^{op}]$ is free as a right $\\ZN$-module and hence flat.  Thus $\\mathbb Z[M\\times M^{op}]\\otimes_{\\ZN} F_\\bullet \\to  \\mathbb Z[M\\times M^{op}]\\otimes_{\\ZN} \\Z\\to 0$ is a free resolution with $\\mathbb Z[M\\times M^{op}]\\otimes_{\\ZN} F_i$ finitely generated for $0\\leq i\\leq n$.  Therefore, $C_0(F)\\cong \\Z[M \\times M^{op}]\\otimes_{\\ZN} \\Z$ is a $\\mathbb Z[M\\times M^{op}]$-module of type $\\FPn$.\nNow since $C_0(F)$ is $\\FPn$ and $C_1(F)$ is $\\FPinfty$ it follows from Lemma~\\ref{t:bieri}\nthat the $\\ZM$ is $\\FPn$ as a $\\mathbb Z[M\\times M^{op}]$-module, and hence the monoid $M$ is of type bi-$\\FPn$.\n\nBy~\\cite[Corollary 4.15]{GraySteinbergDocumenta}, since $N$ is a free product of $G$ and a free monoid\nwe can choose a free resolution of $\\Z$ over $\\ZN$ to have length at most\n$\\mathrm{max}\\{1, \\mathrm{cd}(G) \\}$,\nand so we can deduce from the above argument that $C_0(F)$ has projective dimension at most $\\max\\{1,\\mathrm{cd}(G)\\}$.   Since $C_1(F)$ has projective dimension at most $1$, we deduce that $\\ZM$ has projective dimension at most\n$\\mathrm{max}\\{2, \\mathrm{cd}(G) \\}$,\nand thus $M$ has Hochschild dimension at most $\\mathrm{max}\\{2, \\mathrm{cd}(G)\\}$, by Lemma~\\ref{c:fp.resolved}.  \n\n\nThe fact that the Hochschild cohomological dimension of $M$ is bounded below by that of $G$ follows from~\\cite[Theorem 3.16(2)]{GraySteinbergDocumenta} together with the fact that the Hochschild cohomological dimension bounds both the left and right cohomological dimension of a monoid; see~\\cite[Section~7]{GraySteinbergAGT}."
