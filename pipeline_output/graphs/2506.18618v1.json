We recall these in the following table. \n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l} \n    \\multicolumn{4}{c}{} \\\\ \n    \n    & $H$ elliptic & $a_n$ elliptic  &  definition of $r$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    1& yes & yes & $r(T)=\\id$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    2 & yes & no & $r(T)=\\id$ or $r(T) \\exite  =\\entrye$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    3 & no & yes & $r(T)=\\id$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    4 & no & no & $r(T)=\\id$ or $r(T) \\exitv \\in D_{\\entryv}$ \\\\\n    \\multicolumn{4}{c}{} \\\\ \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\nNote that $T$ must be type 3 or 4, since type 1 and 2 splittings have only one orbit of edges. Additionally, we note that if $a_n$ is elliptic for $T$ it must be elliptic for $T'$. It thus suffices to consider the following cases. In all cases we keep in mind that $$c(\\Core_K(T)) = \\Core_K(T')$$ for any subgroup $K$, and that this  specializes to a number of useful statements when $K$ is $H$ or $\\langle a_n\\rangle$.   \n\n\\textbf{$T$ type 3 collapses to $T'$ type 1 or type 3:} This is trivial since $r(T)=\\id=r(T')$. \n\n\\textbf{$T$ type 4 collapses to $T'$ type 1:} Because the fixed point of $a_n$ in $T'$ is not in $\\Core_H(T')$ we see that the axis of $a_n$ in $T$ is disjoint from $\\Core_H(T)$, so we have $r(T)=\\id=r(T')$. \n\n\\textbf{$T$ type 4 collapses to $T'$ type 2:} \nIn this case the axis of $a_n$ in $T$ maps to the axis of $a_n$ in $T'$ under $c$. After the collapse, say $h\\in H$ maps the exit edge to the entry edge. Before the collapse $h$ maps an edge on the axis after entry to an edge on the axis before entry. So it exactly maps the exit vertex to the entry vertex.\n\n\\textbf{$T$ type 4 collapses to $T'$ type 3:} We have $r(T')=\\id$. If the axis of $a_n$ in $T$ is disjoint from $\\Core_H(T)$ we also have $r(T)=\\id$, so assume this is not the case. Since $r(T) \\exitv \\in D_{\\entryv}$, applying $c$ we get \n$$r(T) c(\\exitv) \\in c(D_{\\entryv}).$$\nSince $a_n$ becomes elliptic in $T'$, its axis is mapped to a point, so in particular $c(\\entryv)=c(\\exitv)$. Since $c(D_{\\entryv})$ contains uniformly finitely many edges, we get that $r(T)$ moves a point only a very small distance, and hence (as in \\cref{L:AlmostWellDefined}) we get that $r(T)$ is a product of a bounded number of separable elements. \n\n\\textbf{$T$ type 4 collapses to $T'$ type 4:} If the axis of $a_n$ in $T$ is disjoint from $\\Core_H(T)$, then the axis of $a_n$ in $T'$ intersects $\\Core_H(T')$ in at most a single point, so we get that both $r(T)$ and $r(T')$ are the identity. In the remaining case it suffices to notice that the entry and exit vertices of the axis in $T$ map to the entry and exit vertices in $T'$. \n\nThis concludes the proof that $r$ is Lipschitz."
