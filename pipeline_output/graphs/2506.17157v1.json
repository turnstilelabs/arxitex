      "proof": "Let $T$ be a tree on which $A_\\Gamma$ acts without global fixed points, and we want to find an edge whose stabiliser is not virtually cyclic. Let $C$ be the Hamiltonian cycle, and let $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_n,v_{n+1}=v_1\\}$ be a cyclic ordering of its vertices. Whenever $m_j\\coloneq m_{v_jv_{j+1}}\\ge 3$ let $z_j\\coloneq z_{v_jv_{j+1}}$. Let $g_1=v_1$, and inductively define\n    $$g_{i+1}=\\begin{cases}\n        v_{j+1}&\\mbox{ if }g_i=v_j\\mbox{ and }m_{j}=2;\\\\\n        z_{j}&\\mbox{ if }g_i=v_j\\mbox{ and }m_{j}\\ge 3;\\\\\n        v_{j+1}&\\mbox{ if }g_i=z_j.\n    \\end{cases}$$\n    In other words, two consecutive $g_i$ and $g_{i+1}$ are either the vertices of an edge of $C$ with label $2$, or a vertex of an edge of $C$ with label at least $3$ and the generator of the corresponding centre. See Figure~\\ref{fig:cycle_of_gens_and_centers} for an example. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htp]\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, alt={Example of how to inductively construct $g_i$ so that every two consecutive $g$ generate a free abelian group of rank $2$.}]{img/cycle_of_gens_and_centers.pdf}\n        \\caption{Here $\\Gamma$ is the square on the left. Then we set $g_1=a$, $g_2=b$, $g_3=z_{bc}$, and so on. This way, every two consecutive $g_i$ generate a copy of $\\Z^2$.}\n        \\label{fig:cycle_of_gens_and_centers}\n    \\end{figure}\n\n    Now define $G_i\\coloneq \\langle g_i,g_{i+1}\\rangle \\cong \\Z^2$. By construction $G_{i-1}\\cap G_{i}=\\langle g_i\\rangle$ (this is a consequence of \\cite{VanDerLek} if the subgroups are contained inside different dihedrals). There are two cases to analyse.\n\\par\\medskip\n\\noindent \\textbf{Case I}. Assume first that each $G_i$ fixes a point. If some $G_i$ fixes an edge we are done; thus assume that each $G_i$ fixes a unique point $p_i$. If all the $p_i$ were the same, then $A_\\Gamma$, which is generated by the $G_i$s, would have a global fixed point. So let $p$ be a leaf of the subtree $S$ spanned by the $p_i$, and let $I\\subseteq\\{1,\\ldots, r\\}$ be such that $G_i$ fixes $p$ if and only if $i\\in I$. Notice that $I$ is non-empty, and does not contain all indexes as there is no global fixed point; hence there exist $j,k\\in I$ such that $j-1,k+1\\not\\in P$, where addition is modulo $r$. Let $p_{j-1}$ (resp. $p_{k+1}$) be the point fixed by $G_{j-1}$ (resp. $G_{k+1}$). This way, $g_j\\in G_{j-1}\\cap G_j$ fixes the non-trivial segment $[p_{j-1}, p]$, and similarly $g_{k+1}\\in G_{k}\\cap G_{k+1}$ fixes $[p_{k+1}, p]$. As $p$ was a leaf of $S$, the two segments share an edge, so $ \\langle g_j, g_{k+1}\\rangle$ fixes an edge. Now, $g_i$ and $g_{k+1}$ are infinite order elements without a non-trivial common power, as they are either two different vertices, or a vertex and the generator of a centre, or the generators of the centres of two different dihedrals (in all three cases, the absence of a common power follows immediately from \\cite{VanDerLek}). In particular $\\langle g_j, g_{k+1}\\rangle$ is not virtually cyclic and fixes an edge, proving that $A_\\Gamma$ does not split over virtually cyclic groups.\n\\par\\medskip\n\\noindent \\textbf{Case II}. Assume now that some $G_i$ has no fixed points, say $G_1$ without loss of generality. By Lemma~\\ref{lem:Z^2_no_fix}, we can assume without loss of generality that $g_2$ acts loxodromically, so it acts by translations on some geodesic line $A$. By Lemma~\\ref{lem:commuting_elm_and_minset}, $g_1(A)=A$, so there exist integers $k_1,k_2$, with $k_1\\neq 0$, such that $h=g_1^{k_1}g_2^{k_2}$ fixes $A$ pointwise. For the same reason, there exist integers $l_2,l_3$, with $l_3\\neq 0$, such that $h'=g_2^{l_2}g_3^{l_3}$ fixes $A$ pointwise. Notice that, since $h\\in G_1$, $h'\\in G_2$, and $G_1\\cap G_2=\\langle g_2\\rangle$, we get that $h$ and $h'$ are infinite order elements without a non-trivial common power. Hence, as in Case I, the fact that $\\langle h, h'\\rangle$ fixes an edge concludes the proof."

As argued above, $v$ and $v'$ cannot belong to the same two-edges segment, so they are at distance $n\\ge 3$ in $\\Gamma$. Furthermore, if we take a combinatorial path $v=v_0, \\ldots, v_n=v'$ from $v$ to $v'$, there must be some index $0<i<n-1$ such that $\\langle v_{i-1}, v_i, v_{i+1}\\rangle$ and $\\langle v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}\\rangle$ fix different points.

If it fixes some $x\\in V_0$ then $w\\in \\Stab{\\Omega}{x}$, which is a vertex group of $T$ and is therefore contained in a big chunk parabolic $H$. However, by Remark~\\ref{rem:retraction} there is a retraction $\\rho\\colon A_\\Gamma\\to H$, which is absurd as $\\rho$ fixes $w$ and is not a conjugation.\n\nNow assume that $w$ fixes the cylinder $C_e$, for some edge $e$ of $T$. We want to show that $w$ acts elliptically on $T$, from which we shall deduce a contradiction with the exact same argument as above.\n\nSuppose first that $e$ connects a black and a red vertex, so that $\\Stab{\\Omega}{e}=g\\langle z_{ab}\\rangle g^{-1}$ for some braided even leaf $\\{a,b\\}$ and some $g\\in A_\\Gamma$. Up to replacing $w$ by $gwg^{-1}$, which has the same characterisation as $w$ in terms of endomorphisms, we can assume that $g=1$. Since $w$ commensurates $\\Stab{\\Omega}{e}$, there are non-trivial integers $m,n\\in \\Z-\\{0\\}$ such that $w z_{ab}^m w^{-1}=z_{ab}^n$. By looking at the retraction $\\rho\\colon A_\\Gamma\\to \\langle a,b\\rangle $, where $z_{ab}$ is central, we see that $m=n$, so $w$ and $z_{ab}^n$ commute. But then the conjugation $\\psi$ by $z_{ab}^n$ fixes $w$, so $\\psi$ must coincide with the conjugation by a power of $w$. Hence it must be that $w$ is a root of $z_{ab}^n$, since a torsion-free acylindrically hyperbolic group is centerless \\cite[Corollary 7.2]{Osin_AH}. This means that $w$ acts elliptically on $T$ as one of its powers does, as required.\n\nWe are left to consider the case where $e$ is an edge whose stabiliser is conjugate to $\\langle s\\rangle$, for some separating vertex $s$. As above, up to conjugating $w$ we can assume that $w$ commensurates $\\langle s\\rangle$, so there are non-trivial integers $m,n\\in \\Z-\\{0\\}$ such that $w s^m w^{-1}=s^n$. By looking at the map $\\rho\\colon A_\\Gamma\\to \\Z$ sending every generator to $1$ we see that $m=n$, so exactly as above we get that $w$ is a root of $s^n$, and in particular acts elliptically on $T$, as required."
