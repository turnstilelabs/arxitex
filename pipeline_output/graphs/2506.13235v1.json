      "proof": "Let us first mention that, given a group $H$, transvections in $\\mathrm{FGL}(H)$ behave well with respect to commutators, in the sense that:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Commutators}\n        \\forall f,r,s\\in H,\\ \\forall\\lambda,\\mu\\in\\field,\\ \\tau_{r,f}(-\\lambda)\\tau_{f,s}(-\\mu)\\tau_{r,f}(\\lambda)\\tau_{f,s}(\\mu)=\\tau_{r,s}(\\lambda).\n\\end{equation}\nOur goal is to use this identity when $r<f<s$, for the transvections to be in $\\text{FU}(H)$.\n\n\\smallskip \n\nLet us now prove that $\\upcloner{\\Z^d}$ has the decreasing length property, where $\\Z^d$ is endowed with the lexicographic order and with its canonical basis $\\lbrace e_{1},\\dots,e_{d}\\rbrace$ as a finite generating set. Let $R$ be a finite subset of $\\Z^d$, of length $\\ge 2$, and let us enumerate its elements in an ordered way: $R=\\lbrace r_{1}<\\dots <r_{n}\\rbrace$, with $n=|R|$. The case $|R|=1$ is immediate since we can write $\\text{FU}(R)=r_{1}+\\text{FU}(\\lbrace 0\\rbrace)$. If $|R|\\ge  3$, then we set $R_{1}=\\lbrace r_{1},r_{2}\\rbrace$ and $R_{2}=\\lbrace r_{2},r_{3},\\dots,r_{n}\\rbrace$, whose lengths are less than the one of $R$, and we apply~\\eqref{eq:Commutators} to $r=r_{1}$, $f=r_{2}$ and $r=r_{i}$ for each $i\\in\\lbrace 3,\\ldots,n\\rbrace$, to get that $\\text{FU}(R)$ is generated by $\\text{FU}(R_{1})$ and $\\text{FU}(R_{2})$. Let us finally assume that $R$ has cardinality $2$. Since $r_{1}<r_{2}$, we can write\n\\begin{equation*}\n        r_2-r_1=(0,\\ldots,0,k_i,k_{i+1},\\ldots,k_d),\n\\end{equation*}\nwith $k_{i}\\ge 1$. We know that $|r_{2}-r_{1}-e_{i}|_{\\Z^d}<|r_{2}-r_{1}|_{\\Z^d}\\le  |r_{2}|_{\\Z^d}+|r_{1}|_{\\Z^d}$, namely $|r_{2}-r_{1}-e_{i}|_{\\Z^d}<|R|_{\\Z^d}$. There are several cases to consider.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $k_{i}\\ge 2$, then $r_{2}-r_{1}-e_{i}>0$. We thus have $r_{1}<r_{1}+e_{i}<r_{2}$, so applying~\\eqref{eq:Commutators} to $r=r_{1}$, $s=r_{2}$ and $f=r_{1}+e_{i}$, we get that\n    \\begin{equation*}\n            \\text{FU}(R)\\leqslant \\text{FU}(\\lbrace r_{1},r_{1}+e_{i},r_2\\rbrace)=\\langle r_{1}+\\text{FU}(\\lbrace 0,e_{i}\\rbrace), r_{1}+e_{i}+\\text{FU}(\\lbrace 0,r_{2}-r_{1}-e_{i}\\rbrace)\\rangle.\n    \\end{equation*}\n    We are done since we have $|\\lbrace 0,e_{i}\\rbrace|_{\\Z^d}=1<|R|_{\\Z^d}$ and $|\\lbrace 0,r_{2}-r_{1}-e_{i}\\rbrace|_{\\Z^d}<|R|_{\\Z^d}$.\n    \\item If $r_{2}-r_{1}=e_{i}$, then $\\text{FU}(R)=r_{1}+\\text{FU}(\\lbrace 0,e_{i}\\rbrace)$ and we are done.\n    \\item We finally assume $k_{i}=1$ and $r_{2}-r_{1}\\neq e_{i}$, so that we can define $i_{0}\\defeq\\min{\\lbrace j\\geq i+1 : k_j\\neq 0\\rbrace}$. Let us set $h\\defeq e_{i}+(k_{i_0}-1)e_{i_0}$. We have\n    \\begin{equation*}\n            (r_{2}-r_{1}-h)_{j}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n            (r_{2}-r_{1})_{j} &\\text{ if }j\\in\\lbrace 1,\\dots,d\\rbrace\\setminus\\lbrace i,i_{0}\\rbrace \\\\\n                0 & \\text{ if }j=i\\\\\n                1 & \\text{ if }j=i_{0}\n            \\end{array}\\right.,\n    \\end{equation*}\n    so that $r_{2}-r_{1}-h>0$ and $|r_{2}-r_{1}-h|_{\\Z^d}<|r_{2}-r_{1}|_{\\Z^d}\\le |R|_{\\Z^d}$. We also have $h>0$, so we get\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\text{FU}(R)\\leqslant L(\\lbrace r_{1},r_{1}+h,r_{2}\\rbrace)\\leqslant\\langle r_{1}+\\text{FU}(\\lbrace 0,h\\rbrace), r_{1}+h_{1}+\\text{FU}(\\lbrace 0,r_{2}-r_{1}-h\\rbrace)\\rangle\n    \\end{equation*} with the same techniques, and we similarly claim that we are done.\n\\end{enumerate}\nSo $\\upcloner{\\Z^d}$ satisfies the decreasing length property."

This simply follows from the set inclusions \n\\begin{equation*}\n    [\\shuf{H},\\shuf{H}]\\subset \\fsym{H}\\times [H,H] \\subsetneq \\shuf{H}.\n\\end{equation*}\nIn fact, it is true more generally that a lampshuffler $\\shuf{H}$ over a non-trivial group $H$ is never perfect, regardless of the perfectness of $H$. Indeed, since the action of $H$ on $\\fsym{H}$ preserves the parity of the permutations, the commutator subgroup of $\\shuf{H}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{A}(H)\\times [H,H]$, where $\\mathcal{A}(H)\\subset\\fsym{H}$ is the set of even permutations. Since $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ is not equal to $\\fsym{H}$ if $|H|\\ge 3$, and since $[H,H]$ is trivial if $|H|=2$, we thus see that $\\shuf{H}$ is not equal to its commutator subgroup.",
