Indeed, if not, then we can select in $\\<F,F_3\\>$ a subspace $F_3'$ of dimension $j$ disjoint from $\\proj_F(F_2\\cap F_4)$.

Indeed, noting that a singular subspace $U_1$ through $F\\cap F_3$ is opposite a singular subspace $U_2$ through $F_2\\cap F_4$ if, and only if, $U_1\\cap (F\\cap F_3)^\\perp\\cap (F_2\\cap F_4)^\\perp$ is opposite $U_2\\cap (F\\cap F_3)^\\perp\\cap (F_2\\cap F_4)^\\perp$ in the polar space $ (F\\cap F_3)^\\perp\\cap (F_2\\cap F_4)^\\perp$ (where we may assume, due to the previous paragraph, that $F\\cap F_3$ and $F_2\\cap F_4$ are opposite), it suffices to verify the claim for $i=0$. \n\nFirst suppose the line $L_1:=\\<F,F_3\\>$ intersects the line $L_2:=\\<F_2,F_4\\>$ in a point $p$. Select a plane $\\pi$ through $L_1$ not in a $3$-space with $L_2$, and choose a point $F_3'$ in $\\pi$ not on $L_1$ and not collinear to $L_2$. As above, we may substitute $F_3$ by $F_3'$ in our sequence of perspectivities. Now none of $\\<F,F_3'\\>$ or $\\<F_3,F_3'\\>$ intersect $L_2$, and so we may assume now that $L_1$ does not intersect $L_2$. Then there is a unique point $p_2$ on $L_2$ collinear to all points of $L_1$, defining the plane $\\pi:=\\<p_2,L_1\\>$. We select a plane $\\alpha$ through $L_1$ not in a $3$-space with $\\pi$. It follows that $\\proj_\\alpha L_2\\in L_1$. Thus we may consider any point $F_3'$ of $\\alpha\\setminus L_1$ and we find that $L_2$ is opposite both $\\<F,F_3'\\>$ and $\\<F_3,F_3'\\>$.
