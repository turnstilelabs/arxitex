      "proof": "Only the direct implication requires a proof. Suppose that ZFC and CH together imply $\\theta_{\\psi}$. Fix $\\cM_n$, for $n\\in \\bbN$, in $\\fC$ and an ideal $\\cI$ on~$\\bbN$.  \n\tLet $\\kappa:=\\max(\\sup_{n\\in \\bbN} |\\cM_n|, 2^{\\aleph_0})$, and let~$\\bbP$ be the forcing notion whose conditions are functions $p\\colon \\gamma_p\\to \\kappa$, where $\\gamma_p$ is a countable ordinal, ordered by the reverse extension (hence $p\\leq q$, i.e., $p$ is a stronger condition than $q$, if $\\gamma_p\\geq \\gamma_q$ and $p\\rs \\gamma_q=q$). \n\t\n\tThis forcing notion is the L\\'evy collapse of $\\kappa$ to $\\aleph_1$. We need two standard facts about forcing with $\\bbP$. \n\tFirst,  in the generic extension there is a surjection from $\\aleph_1$ to $\\kappa$ (\\cite[Lemma 15.21]{jech2006set}).  \n\tSecond,  $\\bbP$ is $<\\aleph_1$-closed (see the last two lines of the proof of \\cite[Lemma 15.21]{jech2006set}). \n\tTherefore $\\bbP$ does not add any \tbounded subsets of kappa (\\cite[Lemma 15.8]{jech2006set}) and in particular it does not add any new subsets of $\\cP(\\bbN)$, or any new elements of $\\prod_n \\cM_n$. \n\t\n\tThese two facts imply that CH holds in the forcing extension and that each one of the structures $\\prod_{n} \\cM_n$, $\\cM$, and $\\cM^+$ is unchanged.  Moreover, since $\\fC$ is assumed to be closed under elementary equivalence, each $\\cM_n$ still belongs to $\\fC$ in the forcing extension. \n\tSince ZFC+CH imply $\\theta_{\\psi}$, in the forcing extension  there exists a formula $\\varphi$ such that for all $\\bar a$ in $\\cM$ we have that $\\cM^+\\models \\psi(\\bar a)$ if and only if $\\cM\\models \\varphi(\\bar a)$. Note that $\\varphi$ belongs to the ground model, as it is a finite sequence of symbols in $\\calL$. \n\t\n\t\n\tSince $\\prod_n \\cM_n$ is unchanged by forcing, and since $\\cI$ is the same (since $\\cP(\\bbN)$ is unchanged by forcing, $\\cI$ remains an ideal on $\\bbN$ in the forcing extension),~$\\cM$ is unchanged by forcing. Therefore  $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ define the same set in the ground model, as required."

This formula is clearly equivalent to (*). The assumption that $C_G(a^G)=\\{e\\}$ for every $G\\in \\cG$ and every $a\\neq e$ in $G$ implies that  (*) is equivalent to $x=e\\to y=e$. \n\n         The conclusion follows by \\Cref{T.eq.groups} \\\\\n\n    (\\ref{1.RecognizingCoordinates}) For a fix prime $p$, in any group in $\\mathcal{G}_p$, we have that $x=e \\rightarrow y=e$ is equivalent to \n    \\[\\tag{**} \\label{Eq.1.re}\t(\\forall z) ~ \\left( [x\\in C(z^G)\\wedge z^p=e] \\rightarrow y\\in C(z^G) \\right).\\]\n        Indeed, notice that for all $z$ of order $p$ or $1$,  if $x= e$, then $x\\in C(z^G)$. If  $x\\neq e$, then $x\\in C(z^G)$ only if $z=e$. Therefore, $x = e \\to y = e$ holds if and only if, \n        \\[\\{z \\mid z^p=e , x\\in C(z^G) \\} \\subseteq \\{z \\mid z^p=e , y\\in C(z^G) \\}, \\]\n        and the equivalence with (\\ref{Eq.1.re}) is clear. We observe that (\\ref{Eq.1.re}) is an $h$-formula as \n        \\[(\\exists z) ~ \\left( x\\in C(z^G)\\wedge z^p=e \\right)\\]\n        is always satisfied. The statement holds by \\Cref{T.eq.groups}."

Suppose $G$ is a simple group and $a\\in G\\setminus \\{e\\}$.

(That is, $T$ is an acyclic connected subgraph of $\\bar\\Gamma$ with the same vertex set.) For every $i\\leq m$ there is a unique path $P(i)$ in $T$ connecting $v(*)$ and $v(i)$. Consider $T(0)=\\bigcup_{i\\leq m} P(i)$ as a subgraph of $T$ and let $d$ denote the graph distance on $T(0)$.  Let $\\sqsubseteq$ be a linear ordering of the vertices of $T(0)$  such that $x\\sqsubseteq y$ implies $d(v(*),x)\\leq d(v(*),y)$, and let $x(1), \\dots, x(k)$ be the $\\sqsubseteq$-increasing list of all vertices of $T(0)$.

For each $1\\leq j<k'$ pick $h'_j\\in G_{y(j)}\\setminus \\{e\\}$. \n\tLet $a'=h_{k'-1}\\cdot\\ldots \\cdot h'_1$. Then, using Lemma~\\ref{L.GraphGeneralities} as before,  $g'''=(a')^{-1} g'' a'$ satisfies $R(g''')=L(g''')=\\{w(*)\\}$. \n\t\n\tIt remains to show that we can assure that $w(*)$ is equal to the distinguished vertex $v$ fixed in the statement of this lemma.

      "proof": "\\eqref{1.Defining2Cycles}\n\tWe claim that the following $h$-formula defines, uniformly in $\\Sym_{n}$ for all $n>2$ and $n\\neq 6$, the set $C_2 \\cup \\{e\\}$: \n\t\\[\n\t\\psi(x):=x^2=e \\wedge (\\forall g)~ (x gxg^{-1})^6=e\\wedge (\\exists g)~(x gxg^{-1})^3=e. \n\t \\]\n\t We remark that the last conjunct is required only in $\\Sym_4$. \n     \n     Since the conjugate of a 2-cycle is a 2-cycle and the product of two distinct 2-cycles is either a 3-cycle or a 2-2-cycle, every 2-cycle satisfies each of the above conjuncts. \n\t \n\tWe now prove the converse. Every element of order 2 is a product of transpositions with disjoint supports (for convenience we will call such permutations $2$-$2$-\\dots -$2$-cycles). \n\t \n\t The case of $n = 3$ is trivial. Suppose that $\\sigma$ is an element of order 2 in $\\Sym_n$ for $n\\geq 4$ and $n\\neq 6$ that is not in $C_2$.\n\t    \n\t    If $n=4$ then $\\sigma$ is a $2$-$2$-cycle. Any two $2$-$2$-cycles are conjugate, and  in $\\Sym_4$, the product of two distinct $2$-$2$-cycles is a $2$-$2$-cycle (e.g.\n\t \t\t$(12)(34) \\circ (14)(23)=(13)(24)$). Thus in this case $\\sigma$  does not satisfy the last conjunct of the formula.\n\t \n\t Now consider the case when $\\sigma$ has a fixed point. Let $\\sigma$ be the product of $k\\geq 2$ disjoint transpositions, $\\sigma=\\prod_{j=1}^k (m_{2j-1},m_{2j})$ and let $m_{2k+1}$ be a fixed point of $\\sigma$. Then $\\sigma':=\\prod_{j=1}^k (m_{2j},m_{2j+1})$ is conjugate to $\\sigma$, and $\\sigma'\\circ \\sigma$ is the $2k+1$-cycle is the $2k+1$ cycle $(m_1 m_3\\dots m_{2k+1} m_{2k} m_{2k-2}\\dots m_2)$. Since $2k+1\\geq 5$, we have that  $\\sigma$ does not satisfy the middle conjunct of the formula. \n\t \n\t This proves the claim in the case when $n$ is odd, and when $k \\leq 3$, and $n \\geq  8$.  We may therefore assume $k\\geq 4$; let us assume $k=4$ and $n=8$ for a moment. In the following special case,  we obtain a conjugate $\\sigma'$ of sigma such that $\\sigma\\circ \\sigma'$ has order 4 and therefore fails the middle conjunct of the formula: \n\t         \\[\n\t         (16)(47)(52)(38)\\circ (15)(64)(73)(28)= (1234)(5678).\n\t         \\]   \n\t      In general, if $k\\geq 4$, then by restricting $\\sigma$ to an 8-element $\\sigma$-invariant subset of its support we can find $\\sigma'$ such that $\\sigma\\circ \\sigma'$ has order 4. This concludes the proof of \\eqref{1.Defining2Cycles}.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPrior to embarking on the proof of \\eqref{2.Defining2Cycles}, \n\twe note that in $\\Sym_n$ for all $n\\geq 3$, $n\\neq 6$,  the set of transpositions $C_2$ is given by the formula\n\t\\[\n\t\\psi(x)\\wedge x\\neq e.\n\t\\]\n      This is however not an $h$-formula. \n     \n\\eqref{2.Defining2Cycles}\n      We need a formula that defines $C_2$ in $\\Sym_n$ for all $n\\neq 6$. To include the case $n= 2$, we can consider the formula:\n    \\[\n    [\\psi(x)\\vee (\\exists y)(\\forall z)~ (z=y\\vee z=e) ]\\wedge x\\neq e .\n    \\]\nThe set $C_k$ of $k$-cycles can now be defined as the set of products of $(k-1)$ pairwise distinct $2$-cycles $c_1,\\dots, c_{k-1}$ such that $c_ic_j \\neq c_jc_i$ if and only if $\\vert i-j\\vert=1$ for $i,j<k$."
