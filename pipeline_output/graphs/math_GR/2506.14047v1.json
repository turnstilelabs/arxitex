      "proof": "[Proof of Claim.]\nWe prove this by induction on the area of $D$.\n\nIf $q$ admits a disc diagram of area 1, this means that either $q$ of $q^{-1}$ is a cyclic conjugate of some word $w_i$, $i\\in I$; therefore, since $w_i$ defines, by\nassumption, a simple cycle in $\\Cay(G,X)$, it follows that either $u=v^{-1}$ or $v=u^{-1}$ is one of the relations from the formulation of the theorem. Hence, assume now that $q$ \nadmits a disc diagram of area $n>1$, and that every word from $\\ol{X}^*$ admitting a disc diagram of area $<n$ the claim holds.\n\nNext we claim that any disc diagram $D_0$ has a region $R'$ with the property that $\\partial R' \\cap \\partial D_0$ is a single non-empty path; in such a case, removing\n$R'$ from $D_0$ results in a diagram $D_0'$ that is again a disc diagram (of area one less that $D_0$), where the edges in $\\partial R' \\cap \\partial D_0$ are replaced\nby the edges from $\\partial R' \\setminus \\partial D_0$ as the new part of the boundary of $D_0'$. Indeed, pick any edge from $\\partial D_0$ and let $R_0$ be the unique\nregion whose boundary contains that edge. If $R_0$ has the required property we are done; otherwise, the removal of $R_0$ splits $D_0$ into a finite number of disc\ndiagrams such that the boundary of each of these diagrams consists of a path contained in the original boundary $\\partial D_0$ and a piece of $\\partial R_0$. Then\npick $D_1$ to be any of these diagrams, and let $R_1$ be any region of $D_1$ containing an edge from $\\partial D_0$. If $\\partial R_1\\cap \\partial D_0$ is a single \nnon-empty path, we are again done, for $\\partial R_1\\setminus \\partial D_0$ is then entirely contained in the interior od $D_0$. Otherwise, the removal of $R_1$  \nsplits $D_1$ into finitely many disc diagrams at least one of which has the property that its boundary consists of a non-empty path from $\\partial D_0$ and a piece of\n$\\partial R_1$, as $\\partial R_1\\cap \\partial D_0$ is a disjoint union of at least two (not necessarily non-empty) paths. Upon letting $D_2$ to be one such diagram,\nwe repeat the construction. However, this process cannot be repeated indefinitely as the areas of $D_0,D_1,D_2,\\dots$ form a strictly decreasing sequence of positive\nintegers. Therefore, we eventually must arrive to a region with the required property.\n\nReturning to the original claim, let $y_0$ be the base point of $\\partial D$ and let $R$ be a region of $D$ such that $\\partial R\\cap \\partial D$ is a single non-empty path\n$\\Pi$. Also, let $z\\in\\partial D$ be the the vertex determined by the factorisation $q=uv$. \n\nConsider first the case when $\\Pi$ does not contain $y_0$. Let $q_1$ be the word labelling $\\Pi$ and let $q_1q_2$ be the label of $\\partial R$ (in the orientation\ndetermined by $\\Pi$). Then $q_1q_2$ is a cyclic conjugate of one of the words $w_i$ or $w_i^{-1}$, so $q_1=q_2^{-1}$ is one of the available relations from the formulation \nof the theorem. On the other hand, if $D'$ is the disc diagram obtained by deleting $R$ from $D$, then $D'$ has area $n-1$ and the label of $\\partial D'$ is obtained from $q$ \nby replacing the occurrence of its subword $q_1$ corresponding to $\\partial R\\cap \\partial D$ by $q_2^{-1}$. If $z$ is situated on $\\partial D$ after we have traversed the boundary \nof $R$, this occurrence of $q_1$ is entirely contained in $u$, so if we replace it by $q_2^{-1}$ we obtain a word $u'$ such that $u=u'$ can be deduced from the relations from the \nformulation of the theorem. By the induction hypothesis, however, $u'=v^{-1}$ can be deduced as well, thus proving the claim. A similar argument leads us to the same conclusion\nwhen $z$ lies on $\\partial D$ before it traverses the boundary of $R$. So, it remains to analyse the case when $z\\in\\partial R$. Then $q=uv=(u_0u_1)(v_1v_0)$, where $u_1v_1=q_1$,\nand so from the region $R$ and the available relations related to its boundary we have\n$$\nu_1 = (v_1q_2)^{-1} = q_2^{-1}v_1^{-1}.\n$$\nBy the induction hypothesis, from the disc diagram $D'$ we have\n$$\nu_0q_2^{-1} = v_0^{-1},\n$$\nyileding \n$$\nu = u_0u_1 = u_0q_2^{-1}v_1^{-1} = v_0^{-1}v_1^{-1} = (v_1v_0)^{-1} = v^{-1}.\n$$\n\nNow assume that the base point $y_0$ belongs to $\\Pi=\\partial R \\cap \\partial D$. Let $y=\\omega(\\Pi)$ and $y'=\\alpha(\\Pi)$ so that the subpath of $\\Pi$ between $y_0$ and $y$ is \nthe longest initial segment of $\\partial D$ contained in $\\partial R$ (corresponding to the prefix $q_0$ of $q$) and the subpath of $\\Pi$ between $y'$ and $y_0$ is the longest \nfinal segment of $\\partial D$ contained in $\\partial R$ (corresponding to the suffix $q_\\infty$ of $q$).\n\nAssume first that $z$ is located on $\\partial D$ between $y$ and $y'$ (including the possibility that it coincides with one of these vertices), so that $z$ is \\emph{not} an\ninterior vertex of $\\Pi$. Let $u_0$ be the subword of $q$ (and indeed a suffix of $u$) labelling the segment of $\\partial D$ between $y$ and $z$, and let $v_0$ be the prefix \nof $v$ labelling the segment of $\\partial D$ between $z$ and $y'$. Since the word $q_0tq_\\infty$ labelling the boundary $\\partial R$ is a cyclic conjugate of one of the words \n$w_i$ or $w_i^{-1}$ (where $t$ labels the part of that boundary) contained in the interior of $D$), we have that the relations from the formulation of the theorem imply \n$$\nq_0 = (tq_\\infty)^{-1}.\n$$ \nIf we delete the region $R$ from the diagram and move the base point to $y'$ (say), we get a disc diagram $D''$ of area $n-1$ such that $\\partial D''$ is labelled by \n$t^{-1}u_0v_0$. By the inductive hypothesis, \n$$\nt^{-1}u_0 = v_0^{-1}\n$$\nfollows from  relations from the formulation of the theorem, and so\n$$\nu = q_0u_0 = q_\\infty^{-1}t^{-1}u_0 = q_\\infty^{-1}v_0^{-1} = (v_0q_\\infty)^{-1} = v^{-1}.\n$$\n\nNow suppose that $z$ is located on $\\partial D$ (strictly) between $y_0$ and $y$, inducing the factorisation $q_0=uv_1$. From the region $R$ and the property of the word\nlabelling its boundary we obtain\n$$\nu = (v_1tq_\\infty)^{-1}.\n$$\nIn such a case, $v_1$ is a prefix of $v_0$, so $v_0=v_1v_2$ for some word $v_2$. However, again by removing $R$ from the diagram similarly as before and by invoking the \ninductive hypothesis, we have $t^{-1}={v_2^{-1}}$ from which we have $t=v_2$ and so \n$$\nu = (v_1v_2q_\\infty)^{-1} = (v_0q_\\infty)^{-1} =v^{-1}.\n$$\nThe case when $z$ is located on $\\partial D$ (strictly) between $y'$ and $y_0$ is analogous to the previous case. Thus the inductive proof of the claim is complete."
